# Alabama Language Project
This is an ongoing long-term collaborative project between the WOLF Lab and the Alabama-Coushatta 
Tribe whose main goal is advancing the efforts of preserving the Alabama language (Muskogean family). Beginning in 2024, Harvard's
WOLF Lab started working on documenting Alabama, improving the existing dictionary, and creating teaching materials
that could be used in the Alabama-Coushatta community. Harvard linguists conduct interviews with native speakers
of Alabama during their visits to the Alabama-Coushatta reservation where they ask speakers to translate certain sentences from English to Alabama and back, pronounce Alabama words and phrases, and judge if certain sentences are well-formed along with when they can be used. As of January 2025, our team has gone on two fieldwork expeditions — one in summer 2024 and one in winter 2025 — with more planned in the future for this long-term project.
