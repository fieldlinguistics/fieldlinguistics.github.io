- title: A quantitative approach to evaluating interictal epileptiform discharges based on interpretable quantitative criteria.

  description: We designed an algorithm to identify five fiducial landmarks, and from these to quantify the six IFCN features of IEDs. We trained a simple model with these features to quantify the probability that the waveform is epileptiform and incorporated into a user-friendly interface. **The interface is available [here](https://github.com/bdsp-core/IFCN6)**. This model may assist clinical electroencephalographers in deciding whether candidate waveforms are epileptiform and may assist trainees learn to identify IEDs.

- title: "EEG-based grading of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome"
  image: ICANS-EEG-2022-11-26.jpeg
  description: CAR-T cell therapy is an effective cancer therapy for multiple refractory/relapsed hematologic malignancies but is associated with substantial toxicity, including Immune Effector Cell Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS). We developed the Visual EEG-ICANS (VE-ICANS) grading scale, a grading scale with a physiological basis that has a strong correlation to ICANS severity. VE-ICANS shows promise as a biomarker for ICANS which could help to improve clinical care through greater accuracy in assessing ICANS severity.
