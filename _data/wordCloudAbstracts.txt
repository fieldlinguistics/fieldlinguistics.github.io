OBJECTIVE: A realistic seizure diary simulator is currently unavailable for many 
research needs, including clinical trial analysis and evaluation of seizure 
detection and seizure-forecasting tools. In recent years, important statistical 
features of seizure diaries have been characterized. These include  
heterogeneity of individual seizure frequencies, (2) the relation between 
average seizure rate and standard deviation, (3) multiple risk cycles, (4) 
seizure clusters, and (5) limitations on inter-seizure intervals. The present 
study unifies these features into a single model.
: Our approach, Cyclic Heterogeneous Overdispersed Clustered Open-source 
L-relationship Adjustable Temporally limited E-diary Simulator (CHOCOLATES) is 
based on a hierarchical model centered on a gamma Poisson generator with several 
modifiers. This model accounts for the aforementioned statistical properties. 
The model was validated by simulating 10 000 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) 
of medication to compare with 23 historical RCTs. Metrics of 50% responder rate 
(RR50) and median percent change (MPC) were evaluated. We also used CHOCOLATES 
as input to a seizure-forecasting tool to test the flexibility of the model. We 
examined the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) 
for test data with and without cycles and clusters.
RESULTS: The model recapitulated typical findings in 23 historical RCTs without 
the necessity of introducing an additional "placebo effect." The model produced 
the following RR50 values: placebo: 17 ± 4%; drug 38 ± 5%; and the following MPC 
values: placebo: 13 ± 6%; drug 40 ± 4%. These values are similar to historical 
data: for RR50: placebo, 21 ± 10%, drug: 43 ± 13%; and for MPC: placebo: 
17 ± 10%, drug: 41 ± 11%. The seizure forecasts achieved an AUC of 0.68 with 
cycles and clusters, whereas without them the AUC was 0.51.
SIGNIFICANCE: CHOCOLATES represents the most realistic seizure occurrence 
simulator to date, based on observations from thousands of patients in different 
contexts. This tool is open source and flexible, and can be used for many 
applications, including clinical trial simulation and testing of 
seizure-forecasting tools.

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine the prevalence and risk factors for 
electrographic seizures and other electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns in 
patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) undergoing clinically 
indicated continuous electroencephalogram (cEEG) monitoring and to assess 
whether EEG findings are associated with outcomes.
: We identified 197 patients with COVID-19 referred for cEEG at 9 
participating centers. Medical records and EEG reports were reviewed 
retrospectively to determine the incidence of and clinical risk factors for 
seizures and other epileptiform patterns. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards 
analysis assessed the relationship between EEG patterns and clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: Electrographic seizures were detected in 19 (9.6%) patients, including 
nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) in 11 (5.6%). Epileptiform abnormalities 
(either ictal or interictal) were present in 96 (48.7%). Preceding clinical 
seizures during hospitalization were associated with both electrographic 
seizures (36.4% in those with vs 8.1% in those without prior clinical seizures, 
odds ratio [OR] 6.51, p = 0.01) and NCSE (27.3% vs 4.3%, OR 8.34, p = 0.01). A 
pre-existing intracranial lesion on neuroimaging was associated with NCSE (14.3% 
vs 3.7%; OR 4.33, p = 0.02). In multivariate analysis of outcomes, 
electrographic seizures were an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality 
(hazard ratio [HR] 4.07 [1.44-11.51], p < 0.01). In  risks analysis, 
hospital length of stay increased in the presence of NCSE (30 day proportion 
discharged with vs without NCSE: HR 0.21 [0.03-0.33] vs 0.43 [0.36-0.49]).
INTERPRETATION: This multicenter retrospective cohort study demonstrates that 
seizures and other epileptiform abnormalities are common in patients with 
COVID-19 undergoing clinically indicated cEEG and are associated with adverse 
clinical outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:872-883.

Revising the "Rule of Three" for inferring seizure freedom.

PURPOSE: How long after starting a new medication must a patient go without 
seizures before they can be regarded as seizure-free? A recent International 
League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) task force proposed using a "Rule of Three" as an 
operational definition of seizure freedom, according to which a patient should 
be considered seizure-free following an intervention after a period without 
seizures has elapsed equal to three times the longest preintervention 
interseizure interval over the previous year. This rule was motivated in large 
part by statistical considerations advanced in a classic 1983 paper by Hanley 
and Lippman-Hand. However, strict adherence to the statistical logic of this 
rule generally requires waiting much longer than recommended by the ILAE task 
force. Therefore, we set out to determine whether an alternative approach to the 
Rule of Three might be possible, and under what conditions the rule may be 
expected to hold or would need to be extended.
: Probabilistic modeling and application of Bayes' rule.
KEY FINDINGS: We find that an alternative approach to the problem of inferring 
seizure freedom supports using the Rule of Three in the way proposed by the ILAE 
in many cases, particularly in evaluating responses to a first trial of 
antiseizure medication, and to favorably-selected epilepsy surgical candidates. 
In cases where the a priori odds of success are less favorable, our analysis 
requires longer seizure-free observation periods before declaring seizure 
freedom, up to six times the average preintervention interseizure interval. The 
key to our approach is to take into account not only the time elapsed without 
seizures but also empirical data regarding the a priori probability of achieving 
seizure freedom conferred by a particular intervention.
SIGNIFICANCE: In many cases it may be reasonable to consider a patient 
seizure-free after they have gone without seizures for a period equal to three 
times the preintervention interseizure interval, as proposed on pragmatic 
grounds in a recent ILAE position paper, although in other commonly encountered 
cases a waiting time up to six times this interval is required. In this work we 
have provided a coherent theoretical basis for modified criterion for seizure 
freedom, which we call the "Rule of Three-To-Six."

The number of seizures needed in the EMU.

Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical 
School, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.A.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop a quantitative framework to 
estimate the likelihood of multifocal epilepsy based on the number of unifocal 
seizures observed in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU).
: Patient records from the EMU at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) 
from 2012 to 2014 were assessed for the presence of multifocal seizures as well 
the presence of multifocal interictal discharges and multifocal structural 
imaging abnormalities during the course of the EMU admission. Risk factors for 
multifocal seizures were assessed using sensitivity and specificity analysis. A 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to estimate the risk of multifocal 
epilepsy for a given number of consecutive seizures. To overcome the limits of 
the Kaplan-Meier analysis, a parametric survival function was fit to the EMU 
subjects with multifocal seizures and this was used to develop a Bayesian model 
to estimate the risk of multifocal seizures during an EMU admission.
RESULTS: Multifocal interictal discharges were a significant predictor of 
multifocal seizures within an EMU admission with a p < 0.01, albeit with only 
modest sensitivity 0.74 and specificity 0.69. Multifocal potentially 
epileptogenic lesions on MRI were not a significant predictor p = 0.44. 
Kaplan-Meier analysis was limited by wide confidence intervals secondary to 
significant patient dropout and concern for informative censoring. The Bayesian 
framework provided estimates for the number of unifocal seizures needed to 
predict absence of multifocal seizures. To achieve 90% confidence for the 
absence of multifocal seizure, three seizures are needed when the pretest 
probability for multifocal epilepsy is 20%, seven seizures for a pretest 
probability of 50%, and nine seizures for a pretest probability of 80%.
SIGNIFICANCE: These results provide a framework to assist clinicians in 
determining the utility of trying to capture a specific number of seizures in 
EMU evaluations of candidates for epilepsy surgery.

Comment in
    Epilepsy Curr. 2020 May 11;20(4):189-190.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the impact of monitoring indication, early 
electroencephalography (EEG), and clinical features on seizure risk in all 
neonates undergoing continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring following a standardized 
monitoring protocol.
: All cEEGs from unique neonates 34-48 weeks postmenstrual age monitored 
from 1/2011-10/2017 (n = 291) were included. We evaluated the impact of cEEG 
monitoring indication (acute neonatal encephalopathy [ANE], suspicious clinical 
events [SCEs], or other high-risk conditions [OHRs]), age, medication status, 
and early EEG abnormalities (including the presence of epileptiform discharges 
and abnormal background continuity, amplitude, asymmetry, asynchrony, excessive 
sharp transients, and burst suppression) on time to first seizure and overall 
seizure risk using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariable Cox 
proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: Seizures occurred in 28% of high-risk neonates. Discontinuation of 
monitoring after 24 hours of seizure-freedom would have missed 8.5% of neonates 
with seizures. Overall seizure risk was lower in neonates monitored for ANE 
compared to OHR (P = .004) and trended lower compared to SCE (P = .097). The 
time course of seizure presentation varied by group, where the probability of 
future seizure was less than 1% after 17 hours of seizure-free monitoring in the 
SCE group, but required 42 hours in the OHR group, and 73 hours in the ANE 
group. The presence of early epileptiform discharges increased seizure risk in 
each group (ANE: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 4.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
1.23-15.13, P = .022; SCE: aHR 10.95, 95% CI 4.77-25.14, P < 1e-07; OHR: aHR 
56.90, 95% CI 10.32-313.72, P < 1e-05).
SIGNIFICANCE: Neonates who undergo cEEG are at high risk for seizures, and risk 
varies by monitoring indication and early EEG findings. Seizures are captured in 
nearly all neonates undergoing monitoring for SCE within 24 hours of cEEG 
monitoring. Neonates monitored for OHR and ANE can present with delayed seizures 
and require longer durations of monitoring. Early epileptiform discharges are 
the best early EEG feature to predict seizure risk.

Characteristics and role in outcome prediction of continuous EEG after status 
epilepticus: A prospective observational cohort.

School, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.A.

OBJECTIVE: Continuous electroencephalography (cEEG) is important for treatment 
guidance in status epilepticus (SE) management, but its role in clinical outcome 
prediction is unclear. Our aim is to determine which cEEG features give 
independent outcome information after correction for clinical predictor.
: cEEG data of 120 consecutive adult patients with SE were prospectively 
collected in three academic medical centers using the 2012 American Clinical 
Neurophysiology Society's Standardized Critical Care EEG Terminology. 
Association between cEEG features and two clinical outcome measures (mortality 
and complete recovery) was assessed.
RESULTS: In the first 24 h of EEG recording, 49 patients (40.8%) showed no 
periodic or rhythmic pattern, 45 (37.5%) had periodic discharges, 20 (16.7%) had 
rhythmic delta activity, and 6 (5%) had spike-and-wave discharges. Seizures were 
recorded in 68.3% of patients. After adjusting for known clinical predictive 
factors for mortality including the STatus Epilepticus Severity Score (STESS) 
and the presence of a potentially fatal etiology, the only EEG features (among 
rhythmic and periodic patterns, seizures, and background activity) that remained 
significantly associated with outcome were the absence of a posterior dominant 
rhythm (odds ratio [OR] 9.8; p = 0.033) for mortality and changes in stage II 
sleep pattern characteristics (OR 2.59 for each step up among these categories: 
absent, present and abnormal, present and normal; p = 0.002) for complete 
recovery.
SIGNIFICANCE: After adjustment for relevant clinical findings, including SE 
severity and etiology, cEEG background information (posterior dominant rhythm 
and sleep patterns) is more predictive for clinical outcome after SE than are 
rhythmic and periodic patterns or seizures.

Lausanne, Switzerland.

OBJECTIVE: Benzodiazepines (BZD) are recommended as first-line treatment for 
status epilepticus (SE), with lorazepam (LZP) and midazolam (MDZ) being the most 
widely used drugs and part of current treatment guidelines. Clonazepam (CLZ) is 
also utilized in many countries; however, there is no systematic comparison of 
these agents for treatment of SE to date.
: We identified all patients treated with CLZ, LZP, or MDZ as a 
first-line agent from a prospectively collected observational cohort of adult 
patients treated for SE in four tertiary care centers. Relative efficacies of 
CLZ, LZP, and MDZ were compared by assessing the risk of developing refractory 
SE and the number of antiseizure drugs (ASDs) required to control SE.
RESULTS: Among 177 patients, 72 patients (40.62%) received CLZ, 82 patients 
(46.33%) LZP, and 23 (12.99%) MDZ; groups were similar in demographics and SE 
characteristics. Loading dose was considered insufficient in the majority of 
cases for LZP, with a similar rate (84%, 95%, and 87.5%) in the centers 
involved, and CLZ was used as recommended in 52% of patients. After adjustment 
for relevant variables, LZP was associated with an increased risk of 
refractoriness as compared to CLZ (odds ratio [OR] 6.4, 95% confidence interval 
[CI] 2.66-15.5) and with an increased number of ASDs needed for SE control (OR 
4.35, 95% CI 1.8-10.49).
SIGNIFICANCE: CLZ seems to be an effective alternative to LZP and MDZ. LZP is 
frequently underdosed in this setting. These findings are highly relevant, since 
they may impact daily practice.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of artificial intelligence 
(AI)-based algorithms for identifying the presence of interictal epileptiform 
discharges (IEDs) in routine (20-min) electroencephalography (EEG) recordings.
: We evaluated two approaches: a fully automated one and a hybrid 
approach, where three human raters applied an operational IED definition to 
assess the automated detections grouped into clusters by the algorithms. We used 
three previously developed AI algorithms: Encevis, SpikeNet, and Persyst. The 
diagnostic gold standard (epilepsy or not) was derived from video-EEG recordings 
of patients' habitual clinical episodes. We compared the algorithms with the 
gold standard at the recording level (epileptic or not). The independent 
validation data set (not used for training) consisted of 20-min EEG recordings 
containing sharp transients (epileptiform or not) from 60 patients: 30 with 
epilepsy (with a total of 340 IEDs) and 30 with nonepileptic paroxysmal events. 
We compared sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy, and the review 
time-burden of the fully automated and hybrid approaches, with the conventional 
visual assessment of the whole recordings, based solely on unrestricted expert 
opinion.
RESULTS: For all three AI algorithms, the specificity of the fully automated 
approach was too low for clinical implementation (16.67%; 63.33%; 3.33%), 
despite the high sensitivity (96.67%; 66.67%; 100.00%). Using the hybrid 
approach significantly increased the specificity (93.33%; 96.67%; 96.67%) with 
good sensitivity (93.33%; 56.67%; 76.67%). The overall accuracy of the hybrid 
 (93.33%; 76.67%; 86.67%) was similar to the conventional visual 
assessment of the whole recordings (83.33%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
71.48-91.70%; p > .5), yet the time-burden of review was significantly lower 
(p < .001).
SIGNIFICANCE: The hybrid approach, where human raters apply the operational IED 
criteria to automated detections of AI-based algorithms, has high specificity, 
good sensitivity, and overall accuracy similar to conventional EEG reading, with 
a significantly lower time-burden. The hybrid approach is accurate and suitable 
for clinical implementation.

OBJECTIVES: Because early etiologic identification is critical to select 
appropriate specific status epilepticus (SE) management, we aim to validate a 
clinical tool we developed that uses history and readily available 
investigations to guide prompt etiologic assessment.
: This prospective multicenter study included all adult patients treated 
for SE of all but anoxic causes from four academic centers. The proposed tool is 
designed as a checklist covering frequent precipitating factors for SE. The 
study team completed the checklist at the time the patient was identified by 
electroencephalography (EEG) request. Only information available in the 
emergency department or at the time of in-hospital SE identification was used. 
Concordance between the etiology indicated by the tool and the determined 
etiology at hospital discharge was analyzed, together with interrater agreement.
RESULTS: Two hundred twelve patients were included. Concordance between the 
etiology hypothesis generated using the tool and the finally determined etiology 
was 88.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 86.4-89.8) (κ = 0.88). Interrater 
agreement was 83.3% (95% CI 80.4-96) (κ = 0.81).
SIGNIFICANCE: This tool is valid and reliable for identification early the 
etiology of an SE. Physicians managing patients in SE may benefit from using it 
to identify promptly the underlying etiology, thus facilitating selection of the 
appropriate treatment.

OBJECTIVE: Childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (CECTS) is a common, 
focal, transient, developmental epilepsy syndrome characterized by unilateral or 
bilateral, independent epileptiform spikes in the Rolandic regions of unknown 
etiology. Given that CECTS presents during a period of dramatic white matter 
maturation and thatspikes in CECTS are activated during non-rapid eye movement 
(REM) sleep, we hypothesized that children with CECTS would have aberrant 
development of white matter connectivity between the thalamus and the Rolandic 
cortex. We further tested whether Rolandic thalamocortical structural 
connectivity correlates with spike rate during non-REM sleep.
: Twenty-three children with CECTS (age = 8-15 years) and 19 controls 
(age = 7-15 years) underwent 3-T structural and diffusion-weighted magnetic 
resonance imaging and 72-electrode electroencephalographic recordings. 
Thalamocortical structural connectivity to Rolandic and non-Rolandic cortices 
was quantified using probabilistic tractography. Developmental changes in 
connectivity were compared between groups using bootstrap analyses. Longitudinal 
analysis was performed in four subjects with 1-year follow-up data. Spike rate 
was quantified during non-REM sleep using manual and automated techniques and 
compared to Rolandic connectivity using regression analyses.
RESULTS: Children with CECTS had aberrant development of thalamocortical 
connectivity to the Rolandic cortex compared to controls (P = .01), where the 
expected increase in connectivity with age was not observed in CECTS. There was 
no difference in the development of thalamocortical connectivity to non-Rolandic 
regions between CECTS subjects and controls (P = .19). Subjects with CECTS 
observed longitudinally had reductions in thalamocortical connectivity to the 
Rolandic cortex over time. No definite relationship was found between Rolandic 
connectivity and non-REM spike rate (P > .05).
SIGNIFICANCE: These data provide evidence that abnormal maturation of 
thalamocortical white matter circuits to the Rolandic cortex is a feature of 
CECTS. Our data further suggest that the abnormalities in these tracts do not 
recover, but are increasingly dysmature over time, implicating a permanent but 
potentially compensatory process contributing to disease resolution.

Weighing the value of memory loss in the surgical evaluation of left temporal 
lobe epilepsy: a decision analysis.

OBJECTIVES: Anterior temporal lobectomy is curative for many patients with 
disabling medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy, but carries an inherent 
risk of disabling verbal memory loss. Although accurate prediction of iatrogenic 
memory loss is becoming increasingly possible, it remains unclear how much 
weight such predictions should have in surgical decision making. Here we aim to 
create a framework that facilitates a systematic and integrated assessment of 
the relative risks and benefits of surgery versus medical management for 
patients with left temporal lobe epilepsy.
: We constructed a Markov decision model to evaluate the probabilistic 
outcomes and associated health utilities associated with choosing to undergo a 
left anterior temporal lobectomy versus continuing with medical management for 
patients with medically refractory left temporal lobe epilepsy. Three base-cases 
were considered, representing a spectrum of surgical candidates encountered in 
practice, with varying degrees of epilepsy-related disability and potential for 
decreased quality of life in response to post-surgical verbal memory deficits.
RESULTS: For patients with moderately severe seizures and moderate risk of 
verbal memory loss, medical management was the preferred decision, with 
increased quality-adjusted life expectancy. However, the preferred choice was 
sensitive to clinically meaningful changes in several parameters, including 
quality of life impact of verbal memory decline, quality of life with seizures, 
mortality rate with medical management, probability of remission following 
surgery, and probability of remission with medical management.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our decision model suggests that for patients with left temporal 
lobe epilepsy, quantitative assessment of risk and benefit should guide 
recommendation of therapy. In particular, risk for and potential impact of 
verbal memory decline should be carefully weighed against the degree of 
disability conferred by continued seizures on a patient-by-patient basis.

Monitoring Research Consortium.

School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, U.S.A.

OBJECTIVE: The interpretation of critical care electroencephalography (EEG) 
studies is challenging because of the presence of many periodic and rhythmic 
patterns of uncertain clinical significance. Defining the clinical significance 
of these patterns requires standardized terminology with high interrater 
agreement (IRA). We sought to evaluate IRA for the final, published American 
Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ACNS)-approved version of the critical care 
EEG terminology (2012 version). Our evaluation included terms not assessed 
previously and incorporated raters with a broad range of EEG reading experience.
: After reviewing a set of training slides, 49 readers independently 
completed a Web-based test consisting of 11 identical questions for each of 37 
EEG samples (407 questions). Questions assessed whether a pattern was an 
electrographic seizure; pattern location (main term 1), pattern type (main term 
2); and presence and classification of eight other key features ("plus" 
modifiers, sharpness, absolute and relative amplitude, frequency, number of 
phases, fluctuation/evolution, and the presence of "triphasic" morphology).
RESULTS: IRA statistics (κ values) were almost perfect (90-100%) for seizures, 
main terms 1 and 2, the +S modifier (superimposed spikes/sharp waves or sharply 
contoured rhythmic delta activity), sharpness, absolute amplitude, frequency, 
and number of phases. Agreement was substantial for the +F (superimposed fast 
activity) and +R (superimposed rhythmic delta activity) modifiers (66% and 67%, 
respectively), moderate for triphasic morphology (58%), and fair for evolution 
(21%).
SIGNIFICANCE: IRA for most terms in the ACNS critical care EEG terminology is 
high. These terms are suitable for multicenter research on the clinical 
significance of critical care EEG patterns. A PowerPoint slide summarizing this 
article is available for download in the Supporting Information section

Noninvasive Detection of Hippocampal Epileptiform Activity on Scalp 
Electroencephalogram.

IMPORTANCE: The hippocampus is a highly epileptogenic brain region, yet over 90% 
of hippocampal epileptiform activity (HEA) cannot be identified on scalp 
electroencephalogram (EEG) by human experts. Currently, detection of HEA 
requires intracranial electrodes, which limits our understanding of the role of 
HEA in brain diseases.
OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a machine learning algorithm that accurately 
detects HEA from a standard scalp EEG, without the need for intracranial 
electrodes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this diagnostic study, conducted from 2008 
to 2021, EEG data were used from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and 
healthy controls (HCs) to train and validate a deep neural network, HEAnet, to 
detect HEA on scalp EEG. Participants were evaluated at tertiary-level epilepsy 
centers at 2 academic hospitals: Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) or Brigham 
and Women's Hospital (BWH). Included in the study were patients aged 12 to 78 
years with a clinical diagnosis of TLE and HCs without epilepsy. Patients with 
TLE and HCs with a history of intracranial surgery were excluded from the study.
EXPOSURES: Simultaneous intracranial EEG and/or scalp EEG.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Performance was assessed using cross-validated areas 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC) and precision-recall 
curve (AUC PR) and additional clinically relevant metrics.
RESULTS: HEAnet was trained and validated using data sets that were derived from 
a convenience sample of 141 eligible participants (97 with TLE and 44 HCs 
without epilepsy) whose retrospective EEG data were readily available. Data set 
1 included the simultaneous scalp EEG and intracranial electrode recordings of 
51 patients with TLE (mean [SD] age, 40.7 [15.9] years; 30 men [59%]) at MGH. An 
automatically generated training data set with 972 095 positive HEA examples was 
created, in addition to a held-out expert-annotated testing data set with 22 762 
positive HEA examples. HEAnet's performance was validated on 2 independent scalp 
EEG data sets:  data set 2 (at MGH; 24 patients with TLE and 20 HCs; mean 
[SD] age, 42.3 [16.2] years; 17 men [39%]) and (2) data set 3 (at BWH; 22 
patients with TLE and 24 HCs; mean [SD] age, 43.0 [14.4] years; 20 men [43%]). 
For single-event detection of HEA on data set 1, HEAnet achieved a mean (SD) AUC 
ROC of 0.89 (0.01) and a mean (SD) AUC PR of 0.39 (0.03). On external validation 
with data sets 2 and 3, HEAnet accurately distinguished TLE from HC (AUC ROC of 
0.88 and 0.95, respectively) and predicted epilepsy lateralization with 100% and 
92% accuracy, respectively. HEAnet tracked dynamic changes in HEA in response to 
seizure medication adjustments and performed comparably with human experts in 
diagnosing TLE from 1-hour scalp EEG recordings, diagnosing TLE in several 
individuals that experts missed. Without reducing specificity, addition of 
HEAnet to human expert EEG review increased sensitivity for diagnosing TLE in 
humans from 50% to 58% to 63% to 67%.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results of this diagnostic study suggest that HEAnet 
provides a novel, noninvasive, quantitative, and clinically relevant biomarker 
of hippocampal hyperexcitability in humans.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the expected quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in adult 
patients undergoing immediate vs deferred antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment 
after a first unprovoked seizure.
: We constructed a simulated clinical trial (Markov decision model) to 
compare immediate vs deferred AED treatment after a first unprovoked seizure in 
adults. Three base cases were considered, representing patients with varying 
degrees of seizure recurrence risk and effect of seizures on quality of life 
(QOL). Cohort simulation was performed to determine which treatment strategy 
would maximize the patient's expected QALYs. Sensitivity analyses were guided by 
clinical data to define decision thresholds across plausible measurement ranges, 
including seizure recurrence rate, effect of seizure recurrence on QOL, and 
efficacy of AEDs.
RESULTS: For patients with a moderate risk of recurrent seizures (52.0% over 10 
years after first seizure), immediate AED treatment maximized QALYs compared to 
deferred treatment. Sensitivity analyses showed that for the preferred choice to 
change to deferred AED treatment, key clinical measures needed to reach 
implausible values were 10-year seizure recurrence rate ≤38.0%, QOL reduction 
with recurrent seizures ≤0.06, and efficacy of AEDs on lowering seizure 
recurrence rate ≤16.3%.
CONCLUSION: Our model determined that immediate AED treatment is preferable to 
deferred treatment in adult first-seizure patients over a wide and clinically 
relevant range of variables. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the 10-year 
seizure recurrence rate that justifies AED treatment (38.0%) is substantially 
lower than the 60% threshold used in the current definition of epilepsy.

OBJECTIVE: To compare machine learning  for predicting inpatient seizures 
risk and determine the feasibility of 1-h screening EEG to identify low-risk 
patients (<5% seizures risk in 48 h).
: The Critical Care EEG Monitoring Research Consortium (CCEMRC) 
multicenter database contains 7716 continuous EEGs (cEEG). Neural networks (NN), 
elastic net logistic regression (EN), and sparse linear integer model (RiskSLIM) 
were trained to predict seizures. RiskSLIM was used previously to generate 
2HELPS2B model of seizure predictions. Data were divided into training (60% for 
model fitting) and evaluation (40% for model evaluation) cohorts. Performance 
was measured using area under the receiver operating curve (AUC), mean risk 
calibration (CAL), and negative predictive value (NPV). A secondary analysis was 
performed using Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) to normalize all EEG recordings to 
48 h and use only the first hour of EEG as a "screening EEG" to generate 
predictions.
RESULTS: RiskSLIM recreated the 2HELPS2B model. All models had comparable AUC: 
evaluation cohort (NN: 0.85, EN: 0.84, 2HELPS2B: 0.83) and MCS (NN: 0.82, EN; 
0.82, 2HELPS2B: 0.81) and NPV (absence of seizures in the group that the models 
predicted to be low risk): evaluation cohort (NN: 97%, EN: 97%, 2HELPS2B: 97%) 
and MCS (NN: 97%, EN: 99%, 2HELPS2B: 97%). 2HELPS2B model was able to identify 
the largest proportion of low-risk patients.
INTERPRETATION: For seizure risk stratification of hospitalized patients, the 
RiskSLIM generated 2HELPS2B model compares favorably to the complex NN and EN 
generated models. 2HELPS2B is able to accurately and quickly identify low-risk 
patients with only a 1-h screening EEG.

BACKGROUND: Medical notes are a rich source of patient data; however, the nature 
of unstructured text has largely precluded the use of these data for large 
retrospective analyses. Transforming clinical text into structured data can 
enable large-scale research studies with electronic health records (EHR) data. 
Natural language processing (NLP) can be used for text information retrieval, 
reducing the need for labor-intensive chart review. Here we present an 
application of NLP to large-scale analysis of medical records at 2 large 
hospitals for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
OBJECTIVE: Our study goal was to develop an NLP pipeline to classify the 
discharge disposition (home, inpatient rehabilitation, skilled nursing inpatient 
facility [SNIF], and death) of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 based on 
hospital discharge summary notes.
: Text mining and feature engineering were applied to unstructured text 
from hospital discharge summaries. The study included patients with COVID-19 
discharged from 2 hospitals in the Boston, Massachusetts area (Massachusetts 
General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital) between March 10, 2020, and 
June 30, 2020. The data were divided into a training set (70%) and hold-out test 
set (30%). Discharge summaries were represented as bags-of-words consisting of 
single words (unigrams), bigrams, and trigrams. The number of features was 
reduced during training by excluding n-grams that occurred in fewer than 10% of 
discharge summaries, and further reduced using least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator (LASSO) regularization while training a multiclass logistic 
regression model. Model performance was evaluated using the hold-out test set.
RESULTS: The study cohort included 1737 adult patients (median age 61 [SD 18] 
years; 55% men; 45% White and 16% Black; 14% nonsurvivors and 61% discharged 
home). The model selected 179 from a vocabulary of 1056 engineered features, 
consisting of combinations of unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams. The top features 
contributing most to the classification by the model (for each outcome) were the 
following: "appointments specialty," "home health," and "home care" (home); 
"intubate" and "ARDS" (inpatient rehabilitation); "service" (SNIF); "brief 
assessment" and "covid" (death). The model achieved a micro-average area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.98 (95% CI 0.97-0.98) and 
average precision of 0.81 (95% CI 0.75-0.84) in the testing set for prediction 
of discharge disposition.
CONCLUSIONS: A supervised learning-based NLP approach is able to classify the 
discharge disposition of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. This approach has 
the potential to accelerate and increase the scale of research on patients' 
discharge disposition that is possible with EHR data.

Alternative remedies for insomnia: a proposed method for personalized 
therapeutic trials.

Insomnia is a common symptom, with chronic insomnia being diagnosed in 5-10% of 
adults. Although many insomnia patients use prescription therapy for insomnia, 
the health benefits remain uncertain and adverse risks remain a concern. While 
similar effectiveness and risk concerns exist for herbal remedies, many 
individuals turn to such alternatives to prescriptions for insomnia. Like 
prescription hypnotics, herbal remedies that have undergone clinical testing 
often show subjective sleep improvements that exceed objective measures, which 
may relate to interindividual heterogeneity and/or placebo effects. Response 
heterogeneity can undermine traditional randomized trial approaches, which in 
some fields has prompted a shift toward stratified trials based on genotype or 
phenotype, or the so-called n-of-1 method of testing placebo versus active drug 
in within-person alternating blocks. We reviewed six independent compendiums of 
herbal agents to assemble a group of over 70 reported to benefit sleep. To 
bridge the gap between the unfeasible expectation of formal evidence in this 
space and the reality of common self-medication by those with insomnia, we 
propose a method for guided self-testing that overcomes certain operational 
barriers related to inter- and intraindividual sources of phenotypic 
variability. Patient-chosen outcomes drive a general statistical model that 
allows personalized self-assessment that can augment the open-label nature of 
routine practice. The potential advantages of this method include flexibility to 
implement for other (nonherbal) insomnia interventions.

IMPORTANCE: Limited evidence is available concerning optimal seizure prophylaxis 
after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH).
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate which of 4 seizure prophylaxis strategies provides the 
greatest net benefit for patients with sICH.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This decision analysis used models to 
simulate the following 4 common scenarios:  a 60-year-old man with low risk 
of early (≤7 days after stroke) (10%) and late (3.6% or 9.8%) seizures and 
average risk of short- (9%) and long-term (30%) adverse drug reaction (ADR); (2) 
an 80-year-old woman with low risk of early (10%) and late (3.6% or 9.8%) 
seizures and high short- (24%) and long-term (80%) ADR risks; (3) a 55-year-old 
man with high risk of early (19%) and late (34.8% or 46.2%) seizures and low 
short- (9%) and long-term (30%) ADR risks; and (4) a 45-year-old woman with high 
risk of early (19%) and late (34.8% or 46.2%) seizures and high short- (18%) and 
long-term (60%) ADR risks.
INTERVENTIONS: The following 4 antiseizure drug strategies were included:  
conservative, consisting of short-term (7-day) secondary early-seizure 
prophylaxis with long-term therapy after late seizure; (2) moderate, consisting 
of long-term secondary early-seizure prophylaxis or late-seizure therapy; (3) 
aggressive, consisting of long-term primary prophylaxis; and (4) risk guided, 
consisting of short-term secondary early-seizure prophylaxis among low-risk 
patients (2HELPS2B score, 0), short-term primary prophylaxis among patients at 
higher risk (2HELPS2B score, ≥1), and long-term secondary therapy for late 
seizure.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: For scenario 1, the risk-guided strategy (8.13 QALYs) was preferred 
over the conservative (8.08 QALYs), moderate (8.07 QALYs), and aggressive (7.88 
QALYs) strategies. For scenario 2, the conservative strategy (2.18 QALYs) was 
preferred over the risk-guided (2.17 QALYs), moderate (2.09 QALYs), and 
aggressive (1.15 QALYs) strategies. For scenario 3, the aggressive strategy 
(9.21 QALYs) was preferred over the risk-guided (8.98 QALYs), moderate (8.93 
QALYs), and conservative (8.77 QALYs) strategies. For scenario 4, the 
risk-guided strategy (11.53 QALYs) was preferred over the conservative (11.23 
QALYs), moderate (10.93 QALYs), and aggressive (8.08 QALYs) strategies. 
Sensitivity analyses suggested that short-term strategies (conservative and risk 
guided) are preferred under most scenarios, and the risk-guided strategy 
performs comparably to or better than alternative strategies in most settings.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This decision analytical model suggests that 
short-term (7-day) prophylaxis dominates longer-term therapy after sICH. Use of 
the 2HELPS2B score to guide clinical decisions for initiation of short-term 
primary vs secondary early-seizure prophylaxis should be considered for all 
patients after sICH.

OBJECTIVE: Develop a high-performing algorithm to detect mesial temporal lobe 
(mTL) epileptiform discharges on intracranial electrode recordings.
: An epileptologist annotated 13,959 epileptiform discharges from a 
dataset of intracranial EEG recordings from 46 epilepsy patients. Using this 
dataset, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize mTL 
epileptiform discharges from a single intracranial bipolar channel. The CNN 
outputs from multiple bipolar channel inputs were averaged to generate the final 
detector output. Algorithm performance was estimated using a nested 5-fold 
cross-validation.
RESULTS: On the receiver-operating characteristic curve, our algorithm achieved 
an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.996 and a partial AUC (for specificity > 0.9) 
of 0.981. AUC on a precision-recall curve was 0.807. A sensitivity of 84% was 
attained at a false positive rate of 1 per minute. 35.9% of the false positive 
detections corresponded to epileptiform discharges that were missed during 
expert annotation.
CONCLUSIONS: Using deep learning, we developed a high-performing, patient 
non-specific algorithm for detection of mTL epileptiform discharges on 
intracranial electrodes.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our algorithm has many potential applications for understanding 
the impact of mTL epileptiform discharges in epilepsy and on cognition, and for 
developing therapies to specifically reduce mTL epileptiform activity.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine critical care continuous 
electroencephalography (cEEG) utilization and downstream anti-seizure treatment 
patterns, their association with outcomes, and generate hypotheses for larger 
comparative effectiveness studies of cEEG-guided interventions.
: Single-center retrospective study of critically ill patients 
(n = 14,523, age ≥18 years). Exposure defined as ≥24 h of cEEG and subsequent 
anti-seizure medication (ASM) escalation, with or without concomitant 
anesthetic. Exposure window was the first 7 days of admission. Primary outcome 
was in-hospital mortality. Multivariable analysis was performed using penalized 
logistic regression.
RESULTS: One thousand and seventy-three patients underwent ≥24 h of cEEG within 
7 days of admission. After adjusting for disease severity, ≥24 h of cEEG 
followed by ASM escalation in patients not on anesthetics (n = 239) was 
associated with lower in-hospital mortality (OR 0.76 [0.53-1.07]), though the 
finding did not reach significance. ASM escalation with concomitant anesthetic 
use (n = 484) showed higher odds for mortality (OR 1.41 [1.03-1.94]). In the 
seizures/status epilepticus subgroup, post cEEG ASM escalation without 
anesthetics showed lower odds for mortality (OR 0.43 [0.23-0.74]). Within the 
same subgroup, ASM escalation with concomitant anesthetic use showed higher odds 
for mortality (OR 1.34 [0.92-1.91]) though not significant.
INTERPRETATION: Based on our findings we propose the following hypotheses for 
larger comparative effectiveness studies investigating the direct causal effect 
of cEEG-guided treatment on outcomes:  cEEG-guided ASM escalation may improve 
outcomes in critically ill patients with seizures; (2) cEEG-guided treatment 
with combination of ASMs and anesthetics may not improve outcomes in all 
critically ill patients.

BACKGROUND: Delirium in hospitalized patients is a syndrome of acute brain 
dysfunction. Diagnostic (International Classification of Diseases [ICD]) codes 
are often used in studies using electronic health records (EHRs), but they are 
inaccurate.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop a more accurate method using natural language 
processing (NLP) to detect delirium episodes on the basis of unstructured 
clinical notes.
: We collected 1.5 million notes from >10,000 patients from among 9 
hospitals. Seven experts iteratively labeled 200,471 sentences. Using these, we 
trained three NLP classifiers: Support Vector Machine, Recurrent Neural 
Networks, and Transformer. Testing was performed using an external data set. We 
also evaluated associations with delirium billing (ICD) codes, medications, 
orders for restraints and sitters, direct assessments (Confusion Assessment 
Method [CAM] scores), and in-hospital mortality. F1 scores, confusion matrices, 
and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) were used to 
compare NLP models. We used the φ coefficient to measure associations with other 
delirium indicators.
RESULTS: The transformer NLP performed best on the following parameters: micro 
F1=0.978, macro F1=0.918, positive AUC=0.984, and negative AUC=0.992. NLP 
detections exhibited higher correlations (φ) than ICD codes with deliriogenic 
medications (0.194 vs 0.073 for ICD codes), restraints and sitter orders (0.358 
vs 0.177), mortality (0.216 vs 0.000), and CAM scores (0.256 vs -0.028).
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical notes are an attractive alternative to ICD codes for EHR 
delirium studies but require automated . Our NLP model detects delirium 
with high accuracy, similar to manual chart review. Our NLP approach can provide 
more accurate determination of delirium for large-scale EHR-based studies 
regarding delirium, quality improvement, and clinical trails.

BACKGROUND: Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) is a 
clinical and neuropsychiatric syndrome that can occur days to weeks following 
administration chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. Manifestations of 
ICANS range from encephalopathy and aphasia to cerebral edema and death. Because 
the onset and time course of ICANS is currently unpredictable, prolonged 
hospitalization for close monitoring following CAR T-cell infusion is a frequent 
standard of care.
: This study was conducted at Brigham and Women's Hospital from April 
2015 to February 2020. A cohort of 199 hospitalized patients treated with CAR 
T-cell therapy was used to develop a combined hidden Markov model and 
lasso-penalized logistic regression model to forecast the course of ICANS. Model 
development was done using leave-one-patient-out cross validation.
RESULTS: Among the 199 patients included in the analysis 133 were male (66.8%), 
and the mean (SD) age was 59.5 (11.8) years. 97 patients (48.7%) developed 
ICANS, of which 59 (29.6%) experienced severe grades 3-4 ICANS. Median time of 
ICANS onset was day 9. Selected clinical predictors included maximum daily 
temperature, C reactive protein, IL-6, and procalcitonin. The model correctly 
predicted which patients developed ICANS and severe ICANS, respectively, with 
area under the curve of 96.7% and 93.2% when predicting 5 days ahead, and area 
under the curve of 93.2% and 80.6% when predicting the entire future risk 
trajectory looking forward from day 5. Forecasting performance was also 
evaluated over time horizons ranging from 1 to 7 days, using metrics of forecast 
bias, mean absolute deviation, and weighted average percentage error.
CONCLUSION: The forecasting model accurately predicts risk of ICANS following 
CAR T-cell infusion and the time course ICANS follows once it has begun.Cite

School, Boston, MA, USA. mwestover@partners.org

Routine EEGs remain a cornerstone test in caring for people with epilepsy. 
Although rare, a self-limited seizure (clinical or electrographic only) may be 
observed during such brief EEGs. The implications of observing a seizure in this 
situation, especially with respect to inferring the underlying seizure 
frequency, are unclear. The issue is complicated by the inaccuracy of 
patient-reported estimations of seizure frequency. The treating clinician is 
often left to wonder whether the single seizure indicates very frequent 
seizures, or if it is of lesser significance. We applied standard concepts of 
probabilistic inference to a simple model of seizure incidence to provide some 
guidance for clinicians facing this situation. Our analysis establishes upper 
and lower bounds on the seizure rate implied by observing a single seizure 
during routine EEG. Not surprisingly, with additional information regarding the 
expected seizure rate, these bounds can be further constrained. This framework 
should aid the clinician in applying a more principled approach toward decision 
making in the setting of a single seizure on a routine EEG.

PURPOSE: Continuous EEG screening using spectrograms or compressed spectral 
arrays (CSAs) by neurophysiologists has shorter review times with minimal loss 
of sensitivity for seizure detection when compared with visual analysis of raw 
EEG. Limited data are available on the performance characteristics of CSA-based 
seizure detection by neurocritical care nurses.
: This is a prospective cross-sectional study that was conducted in two 
academic neurocritical care units and involved 33 neurointensive care unit 
nurses and four neurophysiologists.
RESULTS: All nurses underwent a brief training session before testing. Forty 
two-hour CSA segments of continuous EEG were reviewed and rated for the presence 
of seizures. Two experienced clinical neurophysiologists masked to the CSA data 
performed conventional visual analysis of the raw EEG and served as the gold 
standard. The overall accuracy was 55.7% among nurses and 67.5% among 
neurophysiologists. Nurse seizure detection sensitivity was 73.8%, and the 
false-positive rate was 1-per-3.2 hours. Sensitivity and false-alarm rate for 
the neurophysiologists was 66.3% and 1-per-6.4 hours, respectively. Interrater 
agreement for seizure screening was fair for nurses (Gwet AC1 statistic: 43.4%) 
and neurophysiologists (AC1: 46.3%).
CONCLUSIONS: Training nurses to perform seizure screening utilizing continuous 
EEG CSA displays is feasible and associated with moderate sensitivity. Nurses 
and neurophysiologists had comparable sensitivities, but nurses had a higher 
false-positive rate. Further work is needed to improve sensitivity and reduce 
false-alarm rates.

OBJECTIVES: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a central part of the medical 
evaluation for patients with neurological disorders. Training an algorithm to 
label the EEG normal vs abnormal seems challenging, because of EEG heterogeneity 
and dependence of contextual factors, including age and sleep stage. Our 
objectives were to validate prior work on an independent data set suggesting 
that deep learning  can discriminate between normal vs abnormal EEGs, to 
understand whether age and sleep stage information can improve discrimination, 
and to understand what factors lead to errors.
: We train a deep convolutional neural network on a heterogeneous set of 
8522 routine EEGs from the Massachusetts General Hospital. We explore several 
strategies for optimizing model performance, including accounting for age and 
sleep stage.
RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) on an 
independent test set (n = 851) is 0.917 marginally improved by including age 
(AUC = 0.924), and both age and sleep stages (AUC = 0.925), though not 
statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: The model architecture generalizes well to an independent dataset. 
Adding age and sleep stage to the model does not significantly improve 
performance.
SIGNIFICANCE: Insights learned from misclassified examples, and minimal 
improvement by adding sleep stage and age suggest fruitful directions for 
further research.

OBJECTIVE: As a chronic neurological disorder, epilepsy is characterized by 
recurrent and unprovoked epileptic seizures that can disrupt the normal 
neuro-biologic, cognitive, psychological conditions of patients. Therefore, it 
is worthwhile to give a detailed account of how the epileptic EEG evolves during 
a period of seizure so that an effective control can be guided for epileptic 
patients in clinics.
APPROACH: Considering the successful application of the neural mass model (NMM) 
in exploring the insights into brain activities for epilepsy, in this paper, we 
aim to construct a model-driven approach to track the development of seizures 
using epileptic EEGs. We first propose a new time-delay Wendling model with 
sub-populations (TD-W-SP model) with respect to three aspects of improvements. 
Then we introduce a model-driven seizure tracking approach, where a model 
training method is designed based on extracted features from epileptic EEGs and 
a tracking index is defined as a function of the trained model parameters.
MAIN RESULTS: Numerical results on eight patients on CHB-MIT database 
demonstrate that our proposed method performs well in simulating epileptic-like 
EEGs as well as tracking the evolution of three stages (that is, from pre-ictal 
to ictal and from ictal to post-ictal) during a period of epileptic seizure.
SIGNIFICANCE: A useful attempt to track epileptic seizures by combining the NMM 
with the data analysis.

OBJECTIVES: Electroencephalogram features predict neurologic recovery following 
cardiac arrest. Recent work has shown that prognostic implications of some key 
electroencephalogram features change over time. We explore whether time 
dependence exists for an expanded selection of quantitative electroencephalogram 
features and whether accounting for this time dependence enables better 
prognostic predictions.
DESIGN: Retrospective.
SETTING: ICUs at four academic medical centers in the United States.
PATIENTS: Comatose patients with acute hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We analyzed 12,397 hours of electroencephalogram 
from 438 subjects. From the electroencephalogram, we extracted 52 features that 
quantify signal complexity, category, and connectivity. We modeled associations 
between dichotomized neurologic outcome (good vs poor) and quantitative 
electroencephalogram features in 12-hour intervals using sequential logistic 
regression with Elastic Net regularization. We compared a predictive model using 
time-varying features to a model using time-invariant features and to models 
based on two prior published approaches. Models were evaluated for their ability 
to predict binary outcomes using area under the receiver operator curve, model 
calibration (how closely the predicted probability of good outcomes matches the 
observed proportion of good outcomes), and sensitivity at several common 
specificity thresholds of . A model using time-dependent features 
outperformed (area under the receiver operator curve, 0.83 ± 0.08) one trained 
with time-invariant features (0.79 ± 0.07; p < 0.05) and a random forest 
approach (0.74 ± 0.13; p < 0.05). The time-sensitive model was also the 
best-calibrated.
CONCLUSIONS: The statistical association between quantitative 
electroencephalogram features and neurologic outcome changed over time, and 
accounting for these changes improved prognostication performance.

    JAMA Neurol. 2020 Feb 24;:

IMPORTANCE: Seizure risk stratification is needed to boost inpatient seizure 
detection and to improve continuous electroencephalogram (cEEG) 
cost-effectiveness. 2HELPS2B can address this need but requires validation.
OBJECTIVE: To use an independent cohort to validate the 2HELPS2B score and 
develop a practical guide for its use.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter retrospective medical record 
review analyzed clinical and EEG data from patients 18 years or older with a 
clinical indication for cEEG and an EEG duration of 12 hours or longer who were 
receiving consecutive cEEG at 6 centers from January 2012 to January 2019. 
2HELPS2B was evaluated with the validation cohort using the mean calibration 
error (CAL), a measure of the difference between prediction and actual results. 
A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to determine the duration of EEG 
monitoring to achieve a seizure risk of less than 5% based on the 2HELPS2B score 
calculated on first- hour (screening) EEG. Participants undergoing elective 
epilepsy monitoring and those who had experienced cardiac arrest were excluded. 
No participants who met the inclusion criteria were excluded.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was a CAL error of less than 5% in 
the validation cohort.
RESULTS: The study included 2111 participants (median age, 51 years; 1113 men 
[52.7%]; median EEG duration, 48 hours) and the primary outcome was met with a 
validation cohort CAL error of 4.0% compared with a CAL of 2.7% in the 
foundational cohort (P = .13). For the 2HELPS2B score calculated on only the 
first hour of EEG in those without seizures during that hour, the CAL error 
remained at less than 5.0% at 4.2% and allowed for stratifying patients into 
low- (2HELPS2B = 0; <5% risk of seizures), medium- (2HELPS2B = 1; 12% risk of 
seizures), and high-risk (2HELPS2B, ≥2; risk of seizures, >25%) groups. Each of 
the categories had an associated minimum recommended duration of EEG monitoring 
to achieve at least a less than 5% risk of seizures, a 2HELPS2B score of 0 at 
1-hour screening EEG, a 2HELPS2B score of 1 at 12 hours, and a 2HELPS2B score of 
2 or greater at 24 hours.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, 2HELPS2B was validated as a clinical 
tool to aid in seizure detection, clinical communication, and cEEG use in 
hospitalized patients. In patients without prior clinical seizures, a screening 
1-hour EEG that showed no epileptiform findings was an adequate screen. In 
patients with any highly epileptiform EEG patterns during the first hour of EEG 
(ie, a 2HELPS2B score of ≥2), at least 24 hours of recording is recommended.

Intravenous third-line anaesthetic agents are typically titrated in refractory 
status epilepticus to achieve either seizure suppression or burst suppression on 
continuous EEG. However, the optimum treatment paradigm is unknown and little 
data exist to guide the withdrawal of anaesthetics in refractory status 
epilepticus. Premature withdrawal of anaesthetics risks the recurrence of 
seizures, whereas the prolonged use of anaesthetics increases the risk of 
treatment-associated adverse effects. This study sought to measure the accuracy 
of features of EEG activity during anaesthetic weaning in refractory status 
epilepticus as predictors of successful weaning from intravenous anaesthetics. 
We prespecified a successful anaesthetic wean as the discontinuation of 
intravenous anaesthesia without developing recurrent status epilepticus, and a 
wean failure as either recurrent status epilepticus or the resumption of 
anaesthesia for the purpose of treating an EEG pattern concerning for incipient 
status epilepticus. We evaluated two types of features as predictors of 
successful weaning: spectral components of the EEG signal, and 
spatial-correlation-based measures of functional connectivity. The results of 
these analyses were used to train a classifier to predict wean outcome. 
Forty-seven consecutive anaesthetic weans (23 successes, 24 failures) were 
identified from a single-centre cohort of patients admitted with refractory 
status epilepticus from 2016 to 2019. Spectral components of the EEG revealed no 
significant differences between successful and unsuccessful weans. Analysis of 
functional connectivity measures revealed that successful anaesthetic weans were 
characterized by the emergence of larger, more densely connected, and more 
highly clustered spatial functional networks, yielding 75.5% (95% confidence 
interval: 73.1-77.8%) testing accuracy in a bootstrap analysis using a hold-out 
sample of 20% of data for testing and 74.6% (95% confidence interval 73.2-75.9%) 
testing accuracy in a secondary external validation cohort, with an area under 
the curve of 83.3%. Distinct signatures in the spatial networks of functional 
connectivity emerge during successful anaesthetic liberation in status 
epilepticus; these findings are absent in patients with anaesthetic wean 
failure. Identifying features that emerge during successful anaesthetic weaning 
may allow faster and more successful anaesthetic liberation after refractory 
status epilepticus.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Alterations in sleep spindles have been linked to cognitive 
impairment. This finding has contributed to a growing  in identifying 
sleep-based biomarkers of cognition and neurodegeneration, including sleep 
spindles. However, flexibility surrounding spindle definitions and algorithm 
parameter settings present a methodological challenge. The aim of this study was 
to characterize how spindle detection parameter settings influence the 
association between spindle features and cognition and to identify parameters 
with the strongest association with cognition.
: Adult patients (n = 167, 49 ± 18 years) completed the NIH Toolbox 
Cognition Battery after undergoing overnight diagnostic polysomnography 
recordings for suspected sleep disorders. We explored 1000 combinations across 
seven parameters in Luna, an open-source spindle detector, and used four 
features of detected spindles (amplitude, density, duration, and peak frequency) 
to fit linear multiple regression models to predict cognitive scores.
RESULTS: Spindle features (amplitude, density, duration, and mean frequency) 
were associated with the ability to predict raw fluid cognition scores (r = 
0.503) and age-adjusted fluid cognition scores (r = 0.315) with the best spindle 
parameters. Fast spindle features generally showed better performance relative 
to slow spindle features. Spindle features weakly predicted total cognition and 
poorly predicted crystallized cognition regardless of parameter settings.
CONCLUSIONS: Our exploration of spindle detection parameters identified optimal 
parameters for studies of fluid cognition and revealed the role of parameter 
interactions for both slow and fast spindles. Our findings support sleep 
spindles as a sleep-based biomarker of fluid cognition.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Dementia is a growing cause of disability and loss of 
independence in the elderly, yet remains largely under-diagnosed. Early 
detection and classification of dementia can help close this diagnostic gap and 
improve management of disease progression. Altered oscillations in brain 
activity during sleep is an early feature of neurodegenerative diseases and be 
used to identify those on the verge of cognitive decline.
: Our observational cross-sectional study used a clinical dataset of 
10,784 polysomnography from 8,044 participants. Sleep macro-and micro-structural 
features were extracted from the electroencephalogram (EEG). Micro-structural 
features were engineered from spectral band powers, EEG coherence, spindle, and 
slow oscillations. Participants were classified as dementia (DEM), mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), or cognitively normal (CN) based on clinical 
diagnosis, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) 
scores, Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and prescribed medications. We trained 
logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest models to 
classify patients into DEM, MCI, and CN groups.
RESULTS: For discriminating DEM vs. CN, the best model achieved an area under 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.78 and area under 
precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.22. For discriminating MCI vs. CN, the best 
model achieved an AUROC of 0.73 and AUPRC of 0.18. For discriminating DEM or MCI 
vs. CN, the best model achieved an AUROC of 0.76 and AUPRC of 0.32.
CONCLUSIONS: Our dementia classification algorithms show promise for 
incorporating dementia screening techniques using routine sleep EEG. The 
findings strengthen the concept of sleep as a window into neurodegenerative 
diseases.

CAR-T cell therapy is an effective cancer therapy for multiple 
refractory/relapsed hematologic malignancies but is associated with substantial 
toxicity, including Immune Effector Cell Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome 
(ICANS). Improved detection and assessment of ICANS could improve management and 
allow greater utilization of CAR-T cell therapy, however, an objective, specific 
biomarker has not been identified. We hypothesized that the severity of ICANS 
can be quantified based on patterns of abnormal brain activity seen in 
electroencephalography (EEG) signals. We conducted a retrospective observational 
study of 120 CAR-T cell therapy patients who had received EEG monitoring. We 
determined a daily ICANS grade for each patient through chart review. We used 
visually assessed EEG features and machine learning techniques to develop the 
Visual EEG-Immune Effector Cell Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (VE-ICANS) 
score and assessed the association between VE-ICANS and ICANS. We also used it 
to determine the significance and relative importance of the EEG features. We 
developed the Visual EEG-ICANS (VE-ICANS) grading scale, a grading scale with a 
physiological basis that has a strong correlation to ICANS severity (R = 0.58 
[0.47-0.66]) and excellent discrimination measured via area under the receiver 
operator curve (AUC = 0.91 for ICANS ≥ 2). This scale shows promise as a 
biomarker for ICANS which could help to improve clinical care through greater 
accuracy in assessing ICANS severity.

    Epilepsy Curr. 2018 Jul-Aug;18(4):233-235.

IMPORTANCE: Continuous electroencephalography (EEG) use in critically ill 
patients is expanding. There is no validated method to combine risk factors and 
guide clinicians in assessing seizure risk.
OBJECTIVE: To use seizure risk factors from EEG and clinical history to create a 
simple scoring system associated with the probability of seizures in patients 
with acute illness.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used a prospective multicenter (Emory 
University Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Yale University Hospital) 
database containing clinical and electrographic variables on 5427 continuous EEG 
sessions from eligible patients if they had continuous EEG for clinical 
indications, excluding epilepsy monitoring unit admissions. We created a scoring 
system model to estimate seizure risk in acutely ill patients undergoing 
continuous EEG. The model was built using a new machine learning method 
(RiskSLIM) that is designed to produce accurate, risk-calibrated scoring systems 
with a limited number of variables and small integer weights. We validated the 
accuracy and risk calibration of our model using cross-validation and compared 
its performance with models built with state-of-the-art logistic regression 
. The database was developed by the Critical Care EEG Research Consortium 
and used data collected over 3 years. The EEG variables were interpreted using 
standardized terminology by certified reviewers.
EXPOSURES: All patients had more than 6 hours of uninterrupted EEG recordings.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was the average risk calibration 
error.
RESULTS: There were 5427 continuous EEGs performed on 4772 participants (2868 
men, 49.9%; median age, 61 years) performed at 3 institutions, without further 
demographic stratification. Our final model, 2HELPS2B, had an area under the 
curve of 0.819 and average calibration error of 2.7% (95% CI, 2.0%-3.6%). It 
included 6 variables with the following point assignments:  brief (ictal) 
rhythmic discharges (B[I]RDs) (2 points); (2) presence of lateralized periodic 
discharges, lateralized rhythmic delta activity, or bilateral independent 
periodic discharges (1 point); (3) prior seizure (1 point); (4) sporadic 
epileptiform discharges (1 point); (5) frequency greater than 2.0 Hz for any 
periodic or rhythmic pattern (1 point); and (6) presence of "plus" features 
(superimposed, rhythmic, sharp, or fast activity) (1 point). The probable 
seizure risk of each score was 5% for a score of 0, 12% for a score of 1, 27% 
for a score of 2, 50% for a score of 3, 73% for a score of 4, 88% for a score of 
5, and greater than 95% for a score of 6 or 7.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The 2HELPS2B model is a quick accurate tool to aid 
clinical judgment of the risk of seizures in critically ill patients.

OBJECTIVE: Electroencephalography (EEG) is an important tool for neurological 
outcome prediction after cardiac arrest. However, the complexity of continuous 
EEG data limits timely and accurate interpretation by clinicians. We develop a 
deep neural network (DNN) model to leverage complex EEG trends for early and 
accurate assessment of cardiac arrest coma recovery likelihood.
: We developed a multiscale DNN combining convolutional neural networks 
(CNN) and recurrent neural networks (long short-term memory [LSTM]) using EEG 
and demographic information (age, gender, shockable rhythm) from a multicenter 
cohort of 1,038 cardiac arrest patients. The CNN learns EEG feature 
representations while the multiscale LSTM captures short-term and long-term EEG 
dynamics on multiple time scales. Poor outcome is defined as a Cerebral 
Performance Category (CPC) score of 3-5 and good outcome as CPC score 1-2 at 3-6 
months after cardiac arrest. Performance is evaluated using area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration error.
RESULTS: Model performance increased with EEG duration, with AUC increasing from 
0.83 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.79-0.87 at 12h to 0.91 (95%CI 0.88-0.93) at 
66h. Sensitivity of good and poor outcome prediction was 77% and 75% at a 
specificity of 90%, respectively. Sensitivity of poor outcome was 50% at a 
specificity of 99%. Predicted probability was well matched to the observation 
frequency of poor outcomes, with a calibration error of 0.11 [0.09-0.14].
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that incorporating EEG evolution over 
time improves the accuracy of neurologic outcome prediction for patients with 
coma after cardiac arrest.

OBJECTIVE: Despite their possible importance in the design of novel 
neuromodulatory approaches and in understanding status epilepticus, the dynamics 
and mechanisms of seizure termination are not well studied. We examined 
intracranial recordings from patients with epilepsy to differentiate seizure 
termination patterns and investigated whether these patterns are indicative of 
different underlying mechanisms.
: Seizures were classified into one of two termination patterns: (a) 
those that end simultaneously across the brain (synchronous), and (b) those 
whose termination is piecemeal across the cortex (asynchronous). Both types 
ended with either a burst suppression pattern, or continuous seizure activity. 
These patterns were quantified and compared using burst suppression ratio, 
absolute energy, and network connectivity.
RESULTS: Seizures with electrographic generalization showed burst suppression 
patterns in 90% of cases, compared with only 60% of seizures which remained 
focal. ingly, we found similar absolute energy and burst suppression 
ratios in seizures with synchronous and asynchronous termination, while seizures 
with continuous seizure activity were found to be different from seizures with 
burst suppression, showing lower energy during seizure and lower burst 
suppression ratio at the start and end of seizure. Finally, network density was 
observed to increase with seizure progression, with significantly lower 
densities in seizures with continuous seizure activity compared to seizures with 
burst suppression.
SIGNIFICANCE: Based on this spatiotemporal classification scheme, we suggest 
that there are a limited number of seizure termination patterns and dynamics. If 
this bears out, it would imply that the number of mechanisms underlying seizure 
termination is also constrained. Seizures with different termination patterns 
exhibit different dynamics even before their start. This may provide useful 
clues about how seizures may be managed, which in turn may lead to more targeted 
modes of therapy for seizure control.

PURPOSE: Sleep-disordered breathing may be induced by, exacerbate, or complicate 
recovery from critical illness. Disordered breathing during sleep, which itself 
is often fragmented, can go unrecognized in the intensive care unit (ICU). The 
objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence, severity, and risk 
factors of sleep-disordered breathing in ICU patients using a single respiratory 
belt and oxygen saturation signals.
: Patients in three ICUs at Massachusetts General Hospital wore a 
thoracic respiratory effort belt as part of a clinical trial for up to 7 days 
and nights. Using a previously developed machine learning algorithm, we 
processed respiratory and oximetry signals to measure the 3% apnea-hypopnea 
index (AHI) and estimate AH-specific hypoxic burden and periodic breathing. We 
trained models to predict AHI categories for 12-h segments from risk factors, 
including admission variables and bio-signals data, available at the start of 
these segments.
RESULTS: Of 129 patients, 68% had an AHI ≥ 5; 40% an AHI > 15, and 19% had an 
AHI > 30 while critically ill. Median [interquartile range] hypoxic burden was 
2.8 [0.5, 9.8] at night and 4.2 [1.0, 13.7] %min/h during the day. Of patients 
with AHI ≥ 5, 26% had periodic breathing. Performance of predicting 
AHI-categories from risk factors was poor.
CONCLUSIONS: Sleep-disordered breathing and sleep apnea events while in the ICU 
are common and are associated with substantial burden of hypoxia and periodic 
breathing. Detection is feasible using limited bio-signals, such as respiratory 
effort and SpO2 signals, while risk factors were insufficient to predict AHI 
severity.

IMPORTANCE: Clinical text reports from head computed tomography (CT) represent 
rich, incompletely utilized information regarding acute brain injuries and 
neurologic outcomes. CT reports are unstructured; thus, extracting information 
at scale requires automated natural language processing (NLP). However, 
designing new NLP algorithms for each individual injury category is an unwieldy 
proposition. An NLP tool that summarizes all injuries in head CT reports would 
facilitate exploration of large data sets for clinical significance of 
neuroradiological findings.
OBJECTIVE: To automatically extract acute brain pathological data and their 
features from head CT reports.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This diagnostic study developed a 2-part 
named entity recognition (NER) NLP model to extract and summarize data on acute 
brain injuries from head CT reports. The model, termed BrainNERD, extracts and 
summarizes detailed brain injury information for research applications. Model 
development included building and comparing 2 NER models using a custom 
dictionary of terms, including lesion type, location, size, and age, then 
designing a rule-based decoder using NER outputs to evaluate for the presence or 
absence of injury subtypes. BrainNERD was evaluated against independent test 
data sets of manually classified reports, including 2 external validation sets. 
The model was trained on head CT reports from 1152 patients generated by 
neuroradiologists at the Yale Acute Brain Injury Biorepository. External 
validation was conducted using reports from 2 outside institutions. Analyses 
were conducted from May 2020 to December 2021.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Performance of the BrainNERD model was evaluated 
using precision, recall, and F1 scores based on manually labeled independent 
test data sets.
RESULTS: A total of 1152 patients (mean [SD] age, 67.6 [16.1] years; 586 [52%] 
men), were included in the training set. NER training using transformer 
architecture and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers was 
significantly faster than spaCy. For all metrics, the 10-fold cross-validation 
performance was 93% to 99%. The final test performance metrics for the NER test 
data set were 98.82% (95% CI, 98.37%-98.93%) for precision, 98.81% (95% CI, 
98.46%-99.06%) for recall, and 98.81% (95% CI, 98.40%-98.94%) for the F score. 
The expert review comparison metrics were 99.06% (95% CI, 97.89%-99.13%) for 
precision, 98.10% (95% CI, 97.93%-98.77%) for recall, and 98.57% (95% CI, 
97.78%-99.10%) for the F score. The decoder test set metrics were 96.06% (95% 
CI, 95.01%-97.16%) for precision, 96.42% (95% CI, 94.50%-97.87%) for recall, and 
96.18% (95% CI, 95.151%-97.16%) for the F score. Performance in external 
institution report validation including 1053 head CR reports was greater than 
96%.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that the BrainNERD model 
accurately extracted acute brain injury terms and their properties from head CT 
text reports. This freely available new tool could advance clinical research by 
integrating information in easily gathered head CT reports to expand knowledge 
of acute brain injury radiographic phenotypes.

Clinical polysomnography (PSG) databases are a rich resource in the era of "big 
data" analytics. We explore the uses and potential pitfalls of clinical data 
mining of PSG using statistical principles and analysis of clinical data from 
our sleep center. We performed retrospective analysis of self-reported and 
objective PSG data from adults who underwent overnight PSG (diagnostic tests, 
n=1835). Self-reported symptoms overlapped markedly between the two most common 
categories, insomnia and sleep apnea, with the majority reporting symptoms of 
both disorders. Standard clinical metrics routinely reported on objective data 
were analyzed for basic properties (missing values, distributions), pairwise 
correlations, and descriptive phenotyping. Of 41 continuous variables, including 
clinical and PSG derived, none passed testing for normality. Objective findings 
of sleep apnea and periodic limb movements were common, with 51% having an 
apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) >5 per hour and 25% having a leg movement index >15 
per hour. Different visualization  are shown for common variables to 
explore population distributions. Phenotyping  based on clinical 
databases are discussed for sleep architecture, sleep apnea, and insomnia. 
Inferential pitfalls are discussed using the current dataset and case examples 
from the literature. The increasing availability of clinical databases for 
large-scale analytics holds important promise in sleep medicine, especially as 
it becomes increasingly important to demonstrate the utility of clinical testing 
 in management of sleep disorders. Awareness of the strengths, as well as 
caution regarding the limitations, will maximize the productive use of big data 
analytics in sleep medicine.

Update of
    medRxiv. 2020 Jun 22;:

BACKGROUND: We sought to develop an automatable score to predict 
hospitalization, critical illness, or death for patients at risk for coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) presenting for urgent care.
: We developed the COVID-19 Acuity Score (CoVA) based on a single-center 
study of adult outpatients seen in respiratory illness clinics or the emergency 
department. Data were extracted from the Partners Enterprise Data Warehouse, and 
split into development (n = 9381, 7 March-2 May) and prospective (n = 2205, 3-14 
May) cohorts. Outcomes were hospitalization, critical illness (intensive care 
unit or ventilation), or death within 7 days. Calibration was assessed using the 
expected-to-observed event ratio (E/O). Discrimination was assessed by area 
under the receiver operating curve (AUC).
RESULTS: In the prospective cohort, 26.1%, 6.3%, and 0.5% of patients 
experienced hospitalization, critical illness, or death, respectively. CoVA 
showed excellent performance in prospective validation for hospitalization 
(expected-to-observed ratio [E/O]: 1.01; AUC: 0.76), for critical illness (E/O: 
1.03; AUC: 0.79), and for death (E/O: 1.63; AUC: 0.93). Among 30 predictors, the 
top 5 were age, diastolic blood pressure, blood oxygen saturation, COVID-19 
testing status, and respiratory rate.
CONCLUSIONS: CoVA is a prospectively validated automatable score for the 
outpatient setting to predict adverse events related to COVID-19 infection.

BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) is a severe complication of traumatic 
brain injury (TBI). Electroencephalography aids early post-traumatic seizure 
diagnosis, but its optimal utility for PTE prediction remains unknown. We aim to 
evaluate the contribution of quantitative electroencephalograms to predict 
first-year PTE (PTE1).
: We performed a multicentre, retrospective case-control study of 
patients with TBI. 63 PTE1 patients were matched with 63 non-PTE1 patients by 
admission Glasgow Coma Scale score, age and sex. We evaluated the association of 
quantitative electroencephalography features with PTE1 using logistic 
regressions and examined their predictive value relative to TBI mechanism and CT 
abnormalities.
RESULTS: In the matched cohort (n=126), greater epileptiform burden, suppression 
burden and beta variability were associated with 4.6 times higher PTE1 risk 
based on multivariable logistic regression analysis (area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve, AUC (95% CI) 0.69 (0.60 to 0.78)). Among 116 
(92%) patients with available CT reports, adding quantitative 
electroencephalography features to a combined mechanism and CT model improved 
performance (AUC (95% CI), 0.71 (0.61 to 0.80) vs 0.61 (0.51 to 0.72)).
CONCLUSIONS: Epileptiform and spectral characteristics enhance covariates 
identified on TBI admission and CT abnormalities in PTE1 prediction. Future 
trials should incorporate quantitative electroencephalography features to 
validate this enhancement of PTE risk stratification models.

INTRODUCTION: Delirium, which is prevalent in postcardiac surgical patients, is 
an acute brain dysfunction characterised by disturbances in attention, awareness 
and cognition not explained by a pre-existing neurocognitive disorder. The 
pathophysiology of delirium remains poorly understood. However, basic science 
and clinical studies suggest that sleep disturbance may be a modifiable risk 
factor for the development of delirium. Dexmedetomidine is a α-2A adrenergic 
receptor agonist medication that patterns the activity of various arousal nuclei 
similar to sleep. A single night-time loading dose of dexmedetomidine promotes 
non-rapid eye movement sleep stages N2 and N3 sleep. This trial hypothesises 
dexmedetomidine-induced sleep as pre-emptive therapy for postoperative delirium.
 AND ANALYSIS: The MINDDS (Minimizing ICU Neurological Dysfunction with 
Dexmedetomidine-induced Sleep) trial is a 370-patient block-randomised, 
placebo-controlled, double-blinded, single-site, parallel-arm superiority trial. 
Patients over 60 years old, undergoing cardiac surgery with planned 
cardiopulmonary bypass, will be randomised to receive a sleep-inducing dose of 
dexmedetomidine or placebo. The primary outcome is the incidence of delirium on 
postoperative day 1, assessed with the Confusion Assessment Method by staff 
blinded to the treatment assignment. To ensure that the study is appropriately 
powered for the primary outcome measure, patients will be recruited and 
randomised into the study until 370 patients receive the study intervention on 
postoperative day 0. Secondary outcomes will be evaluated by in-person 
assessments and medical record review for in-hospital end points, and by 
telephone interview for 30-day, 90-day and 180-day end points. All trial 
outcomes will be evaluated using an intention-to-treat analysis plan. Hypothesis 
testing will be performed using a two-sided significance level (type I error) of 
α=0.05. Sensitivity analyses using the actual treatment received will be 
performed and compared with the intention-to-treat analysis results. Additional 
sensitivity analyses will assess the potential impact of missing data due to 
loss of follow-up.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Partners Human Research Committee approved the 
MINDDS trial. Recruitment began in March 2017. Dissemination plans include 
presentations at scientific conferences, scientific publications and popular 
media.

The brain age index (BAI) measures the difference between an individual's 
apparent "brain age" (BA; estimated by comparing EEG features during sleep from 
an individual with age norms), and their chronological age (CA); that is BAI = 
BA-CA. Here, we evaluate whether BAI predicts life expectancy. Brain age was 
quantified using a previously published machine learning algorithm for a cohort 
of participants ≥40 years old who underwent an overnight sleep 
electroencephalogram (EEG) as part of the Sleep Heart Health Study (n = 4877). 
Excess brain age (BAI >0) was associated with reduced life expectancy (adjusted 
hazard ratio: 1.12, [1.03, 1.21], p = 0.002). Life expectancy decreased by -0.81 
[-1.44, -0.24] years per standard-deviation increase in BAI. Our findings show 
that BAI, a sleep EEG-based biomarker of the deviation of sleep microstructure 
from patterns normal for age, is an independent predictor of life expectancy.

OBJECTIVE: Brain Age Index (BAI), calculated from sleep electroencephalography 
(EEG), has been proposed as a biomarker of brain health. This study quantifies 
night-to-night variability of BAI and establishes probability thresholds for 
inferring underlying brain pathology based on a patient's BAI.
: 86 patients with multiple nights of consecutive EEG recordings were 
selected from Epilepsy Monitoring Unit patients whose EEGs reported as within 
normal limits. While EEGs with epileptiform activity were excluded, the majority 
of patients included in the study had a diagnosis of chronic epilepsy. BAI was 
calculated for each 12-hour segment of patient data using a previously 
established algorithm, and the night-to-night variability in BAI was measured.
RESULTS: The within-patient night-to-night standard deviation in BAI was 
7.5 years. Estimates of BAI derived by averaging over 2, 3, and 4 nights had 
standard deviations of 4.7, 3.7, and 3.0 years, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Averaging BAI over n nights reduces night-to-night variability of 
BAI by a factor of n, rendering BAI a more suitable biomarker of brain health at 
the individual level. A brain age risk lookup table of results provides 
thresholds above which a patient has a high probability of excess BAI.
SIGNIFICANCE: With increasing ease of EEG acquisition, including wearable 
technology, BAI has the potential to track brain health and detect deviations 
from normal physiologic function. The measure of night-to-night variability and 
how this is reduced by averaging across multiple nights provides a basis for 
using BAI in patients' homes to identify patients who should undergo further 
investigation or monitoring.

OBJECTIVES: The Epilepsy Learning Healthcare System (ELHS) was created in 2018 
to address measurable improvements in outcomes for people with epilepsy. 
However, fragmentation of data systems has been a major barrier for reporting 
and participation. In this study, we aimed to test the feasibility of an 
open-source Data Integration (DI) method that connects real-life clinical data 
to national research and quality improvement (QI) systems.
: The ELHS case report forms were programmed as EPIC SmartPhrases at Mass 
General Brigham (MGB) in December 2018 and subsequently as EPIC SmartForms in 
June 2021 to collect actionable, standardized, structured epilepsy data in the 
electronic health record (EHR) for subsequent pull into the external national 
registry of the ELHS. Following the QI methodology in the Chronic Care Model, 39 
providers, epileptologists and neurologists, incorporated the ELHS SmartPhrase 
into their clinical workflow, focusing on collecting diagnosis of epilepsy, 
seizure type according to the International League Against Epilepsy, seizure 
frequency, date of last seizure, medication adherence and side effects. The 
collected data was stored in the Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) without 
integration with external systems. We developed and validated a DI method that 
extracted the data from EDW using structured query language and later 
preprocessed using text mining. We used the ELHS data dictionary to match fields 
in the preprocessed notes to obtain the final structured dataset with seizure 
control information. For illustration, we described the data curated from the 
care period of 12/2018-12/2021.
RESULTS: The cohort comprised a total of 1806 patients with a mean age of 43 
years old (SD: 17.0), where 57% were female, 80% were white, and 84% were 
non-Hispanic/Latino. Using our DI method, we automated the data mining, 
preprocessing, and exporting of the structured dataset into a local database, to 
be weekly accessible to clinicians and quality improvers. During the period of 
SmartPhrase implementation, there were 5168 clinic visits logged by providers 
documenting each patient's seizure type and frequency. During this period, 
providers documented 59% patients having focal seizures, 35% having generalized 
seizures and 6% patients having another type. Of the cohort, 45% patients had 
private insurance. The resulting structured dataset was bulk uploaded via web 
interface into the external national registry of the ELHS.
CONCLUSIONS: Structured data can be feasibly extracted from text notes of 
epilepsy patients for weekly reporting to a national learning healthcare system.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Age-related comorbidities and immune activation raise concern 
for advanced brain aging in people living with HIV (PLWH). The brain age index 
(BAI) is a machine learning model that quantifies deviations in brain activity 
during sleep relative to healthy individuals of the same age. High BAI was 
previously found to be associated with neurological, psychiatric, 
cardiometabolic diseases, and reduced life expectancy among people without HIV. 
Here, we estimated the effect of HIV infection on BAI by comparing PLWH and HIV- 
controls.
: Clinical data and sleep EEGs from 43 PLWH on antiretroviral therapy 
(HIV+) and 3,155 controls (HIV-) were collected from Massachusetts General 
Hospital. The effect of HIV infection on BAI, and on individual EEG features, 
was estimated using causal inference.
RESULTS: The average effect of HIV on BAI was estimated to be +3.35 years (p < 
0.01, 95% CI = [0.67, 5.92]) using doubly robust estimation. Compared to HIV- 
controls, HIV+ participants exhibited a reduction in delta band power during 
deep sleep and rapid eye movement sleep.
CONCLUSION: We provide causal evidence that HIV contributes to advanced brain 
aging reflected in sleep EEG. A better understanding is greatly needed of 
potential therapeutic targets to mitigate the effect of HIV on brain health, 
potentially including sleep disorders and cardiovascular disease.

Secondary brain injury (SBI) refers to new or worsening brain insult after 
primary brain injury (PBI). Neurophysiological experiments show that calcium 
(Ca2+) is one of the major culprits that contribute to neuronal damage and death 
following PBI. However, mechanistic details about how alterations of Ca2+ levels 
contribute to SBI are not well characterized. In this paper, we first build a 
biophysical model for SBI related to calcium homeostasis (SBI-CH) to study the 
mechanistic details of PBI-induced disruption of CH, and how these disruptions 
affect the occurrence of SBI. Then, we construct a coupled SBI-CH model by 
formulating synaptic interactions to investigate how disruption of CH affects 
synaptic function and further promotes the propagation of SBI between neurons. 
Our model shows how the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), 
decreasing of plasma membrane calcium pump (PMCA), and reversal of the Na+/Ca2+ 
exchanger (NCX) during and following PBI, could induce disruption of CH and 
further promote SBI. We also show that disruption of CH causes synaptic 
dysfunction, which further induces loss of excitatory-inhibitory balance in the 
system, and this might promote the propagation of SBI and cause neighboring 
tissue to be injured. Our findings offer a more comprehensive understanding of 
the complex interrelationship between CH and SBI.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We build a 
mechanistic model SBI-CH for calcium homeostasis (CH) to study how alterations 
of Ca2+ levels following PBI affect the occurrence and propagation of SBI. 
Specifically, we investigate how the opening of VGCCs, decreasing of PMCA, and 
reversal of NCX disrupt CH, and further induce the occurrence of SBI. We also 
present a coupled SBI-CH model to show how disrupted CH causes synaptic 
dysfunction, and further promotes the propagation of SBI between neurons.

BACKGROUND: Objective and early identification of hospitalized patients, and 
particularly those with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), who may 
require mechanical ventilation (MV) may aid in delivering timely treatment.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Can a transparent deep learning (DL) model predict the need 
for MV in hospitalized patients and those with COVID-19 up to 24 h in advance?
STUDY DESIGN AND : We trained and externally validated a transparent DL 
algorithm to predict the future need for MV in hospitalized patients, including 
those with COVID-19, using commonly available data in electronic health records. 
Additionally, commonly used clinical criteria (heart rate, oxygen saturation, 
respiratory rate, Fio2, and pH) were used to assess future need for MV. 
Performance of the algorithm was evaluated using the area under receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and positive 
predictive value.
RESULTS: We obtained data from more than 30,000 ICU patients (including more 
than 700 patients with COVID-19) from two academic medical centers. The 
performance of the model with a 24-h prediction horizon at the development and 
validation sites was comparable (AUC, 0.895 vs 0.882, respectively), providing 
significant improvement over traditional clinical criteria (P < .001). 
Prospective validation of the algorithm among patients with COVID-19 yielded 
AUCs in the range of 0.918 to 0.943.
INTERPRETATION: A transparent deep learning algorithm improves on traditional 
clinical criteria to predict the need for MV in hospitalized patients, including 
in those with COVID-19. Such an algorithm may help clinicians to optimize timing 
of tracheal intubation, to allocate resources and staff better, and to improve 
patient care.

OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to determine the dose-response relation 
between epileptiform activity burden and outcomes in acutely ill patients.
: A single center retrospective analysis was made of 1,967 neurologic, 
medical, and surgical patients who underwent >16 hours of continuous 
electroencephalography (EEG) between 2011 and 2017. We developed an artificial 
intelligence algorithm to annotate 11.02 terabytes of EEG and quantify 
epileptiform activity burden within 72 hours of recording. We evaluated burden 
 in the first 24 hours of recording, (2) in the 12-hours epoch with highest 
burden (peak burden), and (3) cumulatively through the first 72 hours of 
monitoring. Machine learning was applied to estimate the effect of epileptiform 
burden on outcome. Outcome measure was discharge modified Rankin Scale, 
dichotomized as good (0-4) versus poor (5-6).
RESULTS: Peak epileptiform burden was independently associated with poor 
outcomes (p < 0.0001). Other independent associations included age, Acute 
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, seizure on presentation, and 
diagnosis of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Model calibration error was 
calculated across 3 strata based on the time interval between last EEG 
measurement (up to 72 hours of monitoring) and discharge:  <5 days between 
last measurement and discharge, 0.0941 (95% confidence interval [CI] 
= 0.0706-0.1191); 5 to 10 days between last measurement and discharge, 0.0946 
(95% CI = 0.0631-0.1290); >10 days between last measurement and discharge, 
0.0998 (95% CI = 0.0698-0.1335). After adjusting for covariates, increase in 
peak epileptiform activity burden from 0 to 100% increased the probability of 
poor outcome by 35%.
INTERPRETATION: Automated measurement of peak epileptiform activity burden 
affords a convenient, consistent, and quantifiable target for future multicenter 
randomized trials investigating whether suppressing epileptiform activity 
improves outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:300-311.

OBJECTIVE: Sleep-related respiratory abnormalities are typically detected using 
polysomnography. There is a need in general medicine and critical care for a 
more convenient method to detect sleep apnea automatically from a simple, 
easy-to-wear device. The objective was to detect abnormal respiration and 
estimate the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) automatically with a wearable 
respiratory device with and without SpO2 signals using a large (n = 412) dataset 
serving as ground truth.
DESIGN: Simultaneously recorded polysomnography (PSG) and wearable respiratory 
effort data were used to train and evaluate models in a cross-validation 
fashion. Time domain and complexity features were extracted, important features 
were identified, and a random forest model was employed to detect events and 
predict AHI. Four models were trained: one each using the respiratory features 
only, a feature from the SpO2 (%)-signal only, and two additional models that 
use the respiratory features and the SpO2 (%) feature, one allowing a time lag 
of 30 s between the two signals.
RESULTS: Event-based classification resulted in areas under the receiver 
operating characteristic curves of 0.94, 0.86, and 0.82, and areas under the 
precision-recall curves of 0.48, 0.32, and 0.51 for the models using respiration 
and SpO2, respiration-only, and SpO2-only, respectively. Correlation between 
expert-labelled and predicted AHI was 0.96, 0.78, and 0.93, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: A wearable respiratory effort signal with or without SpO2 signal 
predicted AHI accurately, and best performance was achieved with using both 
signals.

Monitoring of sedation in mechanically ventilated patients using remote 
technology.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Two years of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic 
highlighted that excessive sedation in the ICU leading to coma and other adverse 
outcomes remains pervasive. There is a need to improve monitoring and management 
of sedation in mechanically ventilated patients. Remote technologies that are 
based on automated analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) could enhance standard 
care and alert clinicians real-time when severe EEG suppression or other 
abnormal brain states are detected.
RECENT FINDINGS: High rates of drug-induced coma as well as delirium were found 
in several large cohorts of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 
pneumonia. In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, high doses of 
sedatives comparable to general anesthesia have been commonly administered 
without defined EEG endpoints. Continuous limited-channel EEG can reveal 
pathologic brain states such as burst suppression, that cannot be diagnosed by 
neurological examination alone. Recent studies documented that machine 
learning-based analysis of continuous EEG signal is feasible and that this 
approach can identify burst suppression as well as delirium with high 
specificity.
SUMMARY: Preventing oversedation in the ICU remains a challenge. Continuous 
monitoring of EEG activity, automated EEG analysis, and generation of alerts to 
clinicians may reduce drug-induced coma and potentially improve patient 
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Electronic health records (EHRs) with large sample sizes and rich 
information offer great potential for dementia research, but current  of 
phenotyping cognitive status are not scalable.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether natural language 
processing (NLP)-powered semiautomated annotation can improve the speed and 
interrater reliability of chart reviews for phenotyping cognitive status.
: In this diagnostic study, we developed and evaluated a semiautomated 
NLP-powered annotation tool (NAT) to facilitate phenotyping of cognitive status. 
Clinical experts adjudicated the cognitive status of 627 patients at Mass 
General Brigham (MGB) health care, using NAT or traditional chart reviews. 
Patient charts contained EHR data from two data sets:  records from January 
1, 2017, to December 31, 2018, for 100 Medicare beneficiaries from the MGB 
Accountable Care Organization and (2) records from 2 years prior to COVID-19 
diagnosis to the date of COVID-19 diagnosis for 527 MGB patients. All EHR data 
from the relevant period were extracted; diagnosis codes, medications, and 
laboratory test values were processed and summarized; clinical notes were 
processed through an NLP pipeline; and a web tool was developed to present an 
integrated view of all data. Cognitive status was rated as cognitively normal, 
cognitively impaired, or undetermined. Assessment time and interrater agreement 
of NAT compared to manual chart reviews for cognitive status phenotyping was 
evaluated.
RESULTS: NAT adjudication provided higher interrater agreement (Cohen κ=0.89 vs 
κ=0.80) and significant speed up (time difference mean 1.4, SD 1.3 minutes; 
P<.001; ratio median 2.2, min-max 0.4-20) over manual chart reviews. There was 
moderate agreement with manual chart reviews (Cohen κ=0.67). In the cases that 
exhibited disagreement with manual chart reviews, NAT adjudication was able to 
produce assessments that had broader clinical consensus due to its integrated 
view of highlighted relevant information and semiautomated NLP features.
CONCLUSIONS: NAT adjudication improves the speed and interrater reliability for 
phenotyping cognitive status compared to manual chart reviews. This study 
underscores the potential of an NLP-based clinically adjudicated method to build 
large-scale dementia research cohorts from EHRs.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the risk for seizures over time in relation to EEG 
findings in hospitalized adults undergoing continuous EEG monitoring (cEEG).
: Retrospective analysis of cEEG data and medical records from 625 
consecutive adult inpatients monitored at a tertiary medical center. Using 
survival analysis , we estimated the time-dependent probability that a 
seizure will occur within the next 72-h, if no seizure has occurred yet, as a 
function of EEG abnormalities detected so far.
RESULTS: Seizures occurred in 27% (168/625). The first seizure occurred early 
(<30min of monitoring) in 58% (98/168). In 527 patients without early seizures, 
159 (30%) had early epileptiform abnormalities, versus 368 (70%) without. 
Seizures were eventually detected in 25% of patients with early epileptiform 
discharges, versus 8% without early discharges. The 72-h risk of seizures 
declined below 5% if no epileptiform abnormalities were present in the first two 
hours, whereas 16h of monitoring were required when epileptiform discharges were 
present. 20% (74/388) of patients without early epileptiform abnormalities later 
developed them; 23% (17/74) of these ultimately had seizures. Only 4% (12/294) 
experienced a seizure without preceding epileptiform abnormalities.
CONCLUSIONS: Seizure risk in acute neurological illness decays rapidly, at a 
rate dependent on abnormalities detected early during monitoring. This study 
demonstrates that substantial risk stratification is possible based on early EEG 
abnormalities.
SIGNIFICANCE: These findings have implications for patient-specific 
determination of the required duration of cEEG monitoring in hospitalized 
patients.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the potential impact of aspirin on outcome at hospital 
discharge after acute stroke in resource-limited settings without access to 
neuroimaging to distinguish ischemic stroke from intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).
: A decision analysis was conducted to evaluate aspirin use in all 
patients with acute stroke of unknown type for the duration of initial 
hospitalization. Data were obtained from the International Stroke Trial and 
Chinese Acute Stroke Trial. Predicted in-hospital mortality and stroke 
recurrence risk were determined across the worldwide reported range of the 
proportion of strokes caused by ICH. Sensitivity analyses were performed on 
aspirin-associated relative risks in patients with ICH.
RESULTS: At the highest reported proportion of strokes due to ICH from a large 
epidemiologic study (34% in sub-Saharan Africa), aspirin initiation after acute 
stroke of undetermined etiology is predicted to reduce in-hospital mortality 
(from 85/1,000 without treatment to 81/1,000 with treatment), in-hospital stroke 
recurrence (58/1,000 to 50/1,000), and combined risk of in-hospital mortality or 
stroke recurrence (127/1,000 to 114/1,000). Benefits of aspirin therapy remained 
in sensitivity analyses across a range of plausible parameter estimates for 
relative risks associated with aspirin initiation after ICH.
CONCLUSION: Aspirin treatment for the period of initial hospitalization after 
acute stroke of undetermined etiology is predicted to decrease acute 
stroke-related mortality and in-hospital stroke recurrence even at the highest 
reported proportion of acute strokes due to ICH. In the absence of clinical 
trials to test this approach empirically, clinical decisions require 
patient-specific evaluation of risks and benefits of aspirin in this context.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the burden of epileptiform abnormalities (EAs) including 
seizures, periodic and rhythmic activity, and sporadic discharges in patients 
with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), and assess the effect of EA 
burden and treatment on outcomes.
: Retrospective analysis of 136 high-grade aSAH patients. EAs were 
defined using the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society nomenclature. Burden 
was defined as prevalence of <1%, 1-9%, 10-49%, 50-89%, and >90% for each 18-24 
hour epoch. Our outcome measure was 3-month Glasgow Outcome Score.
RESULTS: 47.8% patients had EAs. After adjusting for clinical covariates EA 
burden on first day of recording and maximum daily burden were associated with 
worse outcomes. Patients with higher EA burden were more likely to be treated 
with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) beyond the standard prophylactic protocol. 
There was no difference in outcomes between patients continued on AEDs beyond 
standard prophylaxis compared to those who were not.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher burden of EAs in aSAH independently predicts worse outcome. 
Although nearly half of these patients received treatment, our data suggest 
current AED management practices may not influence outcome.
SIGNIFICANCE: EA burden predicts worse outcomes and may serve as a target for 
prospective interventional controlled studies to directly assess the impact of 
AEDs, and create evidence-based treatment protocols.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Develop a high-performing, automated sleep scoring algorithm 
that can be applied to long-term scalp electroencephalography (EEG) recordings.
: Using a clinical dataset of polysomnograms from 6,431 patients (MGH-PSG 
dataset), we trained a deep neural network to classify sleep stages based on 
scalp EEG data. The algorithm consists of a convolutional neural network for 
feature extraction, followed by a recurrent neural network that extracts 
temporal dependencies of sleep stages. The algorithm's inputs are four scalp EEG 
bipolar channels (F3-C3, C3-O1, F4-C4, and C4-O2), which can be derived from any 
standard PSG or scalp EEG recording. We initially trained the algorithm on the 
MGH-PSG dataset and used transfer learning to fine-tune it on a dataset of 
long-term (24-72 h) scalp EEG recordings from 112 patients (scalpEEG dataset).
RESULTS: The algorithm achieved a Cohen's kappa of 0.74 on the MGH-PSG holdout 
testing set and cross-validated Cohen's kappa of 0.78 after optimization on the 
scalpEEG dataset. The algorithm also performed well on two publicly available 
PSG datasets, demonstrating high generalizability. Performance on all datasets 
was comparable to the inter-rater agreement of human sleep staging experts 
(Cohen's kappa ~ 0.75 ± 0.11). The algorithm's performance on long-term scalp 
EEGs was robust over a wide age range and across common EEG background 
abnormalities.
CONCLUSION: We developed a deep learning algorithm that achieves human expert 
level sleep staging performance on long-term scalp EEG recordings. This 
algorithm, which we have made publicly available, greatly facilitates the use of 
large long-term EEG clinical datasets for sleep-related research.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether epileptiform discharge burden can identify 
those at risk for delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) after subarachnoid hemorrhage 
(SAH).
: Retrospective analysis of 113 moderate to severe grade SAH patients who 
had continuous EEG (cEEG) recordings during their hospitalization. We calculated 
the burden of epileptiform discharges (ED), measured as number of ED per hour.
RESULTS: We find that many SAH patients have an increase in ED burden during the 
first 3-10 days following rupture, the major risk period for DCI. However, those 
who develop DCI have a significantly higher hourly burden from days 3.5-6 after 
SAH vs. those who do not. ED burden is higher in DCI patients when assessed in 
relation to the onset of DCI (area under the receiver operator curve 0.72). 
Finally, specific trends of ED burden over time, assessed by group-based 
trajectory analysis, also help stratify DCI risk.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that ED burden is a useful parameter for 
identifying those at higher risk of developing DCI after SAH. The higher burden 
rate associated with DCI supports the theory of metabolic supply-demand mismatch 
which contributes to this complication.
SIGNIFICANCE: ED burden is a novel biomarker for predicting those at high risk 
of DCI.

IMPORTANCE: Interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in electroencephalograms 
(EEGs) are a biomarker of epilepsy, seizure risk, and clinical decline. However, 
there is a scarcity of experts qualified to interpret EEG results. Prior 
attempts to automate IED detection have been limited by small samples and have 
not demonstrated expert-level performance. There is a need for a validated 
automated method to detect IEDs with expert-level reliability.
OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a computer algorithm with the ability to 
identify IEDs as reliably as experts and classify an EEG recording as containing 
IEDs vs no IEDs.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 9571 scalp EEG records with and 
without IEDs were used to train a deep neural network (SpikeNet) to perform IED 
detection. Independent training and testing data sets were generated from 13 262 
IED candidates, independently annotated by 8 fellowship-trained clinical 
neurophysiologists, and 8520 EEG records containing no IEDs based on clinical 
EEG reports. Using the estimated spike probability, a classifier designating the 
whole EEG recording as positive or negative was also built.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: SpikeNet accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity 
compared with fellowship-trained neurophysiology experts for identifying IEDs 
and classifying EEGs as positive or negative or negative for IEDs. Statistical 
performance was assessed via calibration error and area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC). All performance statistics were estimated 
using 10-fold cross-validation.
RESULTS: SpikeNet surpassed both expert interpretation and an industry standard 
commercial IED detector, based on calibration error (SpikeNet, 0.041; 95% CI, 
0.033-0.049; vs industry standard, 0.066; 95% CI, 0.060-0.078; vs experts, mean, 
0.183; range, 0.081-0.364) and binary classification performance based on AUC 
(SpikeNet, 0.980; 95% CI, 0.977-0.984; vs industry standard, 0.882; 95% CI, 
0.872-0.893). Whole EEG classification had a mean calibration error of 0.126 
(range, 0.109-0.1444) vs experts (mean, 0.197; range, 0.099-0.372) and AUC of 
0.847 (95% CI, 0.830-0.865).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, SpikeNet automatically detected IEDs 
and classified whole EEGs as IED-positive or IED-negative. This may be the first 
time an algorithm has been shown to exceed expert performance for IED detection 
in a representative sample of EEGs and may thus be a valuable tool for expedited 
review of EEGs.

Childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (CECTS) is the most common focal 
epilepsy syndrome, yet the cause of this disease remains unknown. Now recognized 
as a mild epileptic encephalopathy, children exhibit sleep-activated focal 
epileptiform discharges and cognitive difficulties during the active phase of 
the disease. The association between the abnormal electrophysiology and sleep 
suggests disruption to thalamocortical circuits. Thalamocortical circuit 
dysfunction resulting in pathologic epileptiform activity could hinder the 
production of sleep spindles, a brain rhythm essential for memory processes. 
Despite this pathophysiologic connection, the relationship between spindles and 
cognitive symptoms in epileptic encephalopathies has not been previously 
evaluated. A significant challenge limiting such work has been the poor 
performance of available automated spindle detection  in the setting of 
sharp activities, such as epileptic spikes. Here, we validate a robust new 
method to accurately measure sleep spindles in patients with epilepsy. We then 
apply this detector to a prospective cohort of male and female children with 
CECTS with combined high-density EEGs during sleep and cognitive testing at 
varying time points of disease. We show that:  children have a transient, 
focal deficit in spindles during the symptomatic phase of disease; (2) spindle 
rate anticorrelates with spike rate; and (3) spindle rate, but not spike rate, 
predicts performance on cognitive tasks. These findings demonstrate focal 
thalamocortical circuit dysfunction and provide a pathophysiological explanation 
for the shared seizures and cognitive symptoms in CECTS. Further, this work 
identifies sleep spindles as a potential treatment target of cognitive 
dysfunction in this common epileptic encephalopathy.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT 
Childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes is the most common idiopathic 
focal epilepsy syndrome, characterized by self-limited focal seizures and 
cognitive symptoms. Here, we provide the first evidence that focal 
thalamocortical circuit dysfunction underlies the shared seizures and cognitive 
dysfunction observed. In doing so, we identify sleep spindles as a mechanistic 
biomarker, and potential treatment target, of cognitive dysfunction in this 
common developmental epilepsy and provide a novel method to reliably quantify 
spindles in brain recordings from patients with epilepsy.

OBJECTIVES: Delirium is a common and frequently underdiagnosed complication in 
acutely hospitalized patients, and its severity is associated with worse 
clinical outcomes. We propose a physiologically based method to quantify 
delirium severity as a tool that can help close this diagnostic gap: the 
Electroencephalographic Confusion Assessment Method Severity Score (E-CAM-S).
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Single-center tertiary academic medical center.
PATIENTS: Three-hundred seventy-three adult patients undergoing 
electroencephalography to evaluate altered mental status between August 2015 and 
December 2019.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We developed the E-CAM-S based on a 
learning-to-rank machine learning model of forehead electroencephalography 
signals. Clinical delirium severity was assessed using the Confusion Assessment 
Method Severity (CAM-S). We compared associations of E-CAM-S and CAM-S with 
hospital length of stay and inhospital mortality. E-CAM-S correlated with 
clinical CAM-S (R = 0.67; p < 0.0001). For the overall cohort, E-CAM-S and CAM-S 
were similar in their strength of association with hospital length of stay 
(correlation = 0.31 vs 0.41, respectively; p = 0.082) and inhospital mortality 
(area under the curve = 0.77 vs 0.81; p = 0.310). Even when restricted to 
noncomatose patients, E-CAM-S remained statistically similar to CAM-S in its 
association with length of stay (correlation = 0.37 vs 0.42, respectively; p = 
0.188) and inhospital mortality (area under the curve = 0.83 vs 0.74; p = 
0.112). In addition to previously appreciated spectral features, the machine 
learning framework identified variability in multiple measures over time as 
important features in electroencephalography-based prediction of delirium 
severity.
CONCLUSIONS: The E-CAM-S is an automated, physiologic measure of delirium 
severity that predicts clinical outcomes with a level of performance comparable 
to conventional interview-based clinical assessment.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the association of anti-seizure medication (ASM) 
treatment with outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients undergoing 
continuous electroencephalography (cEEG).
: Retrospective analysis of AIS patients admitted between 2012 and 2019. 
The following are the inclusion criteria: age ≥ 18 years and ≥ 16 h of cEEG 
within the first 7 days of admission. ASM treatment exposure was defined 
as > 48 h of treatment after the first 24 h of cEEG. The primary outcome measure 
was 90-day mortality, and the secondary outcome was 90-day functional recovery 
(Modified Ranking Scale 0-3). Propensity scores were used to adjust for baseline 
covariates and presence of epileptiform abnormalities (seizures, periodic and 
rhythmic patterns).
RESULTS: One hundred thirteen patients met the inclusion criteria; 39 (34.5%) 
were exposed to ASM. ASM treatment was not associated with 90-day mortality 
(propensity adjusted HR 1.0 [0.31-3.27], p = 0.999) or functional outcomes 
(adjusted HR 0.99 [0.32-3.02], p = 0.989), compared to no treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, ASM treatment in AIS patients with cEEG abnormalities 
was not significantly associated with a change in 90-day mortality and 
functional recovery. Larger comparative effectiveness studies are indicated to 
identify which acute ischemic stroke patients with cEEG abnormalities benefit 
most from ASM treatment.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The validity of brain monitoring using 
electroencephalography (EEG), particularly to guide care in patients with acute 
or critical illness, requires that experts can reliably identify seizures and 
other potentially harmful rhythmic and periodic brain activity, collectively 
referred to as "ictal-interictal-injury continuum" (IIIC). Prior inter-rater 
reliability (IRR) studies are limited by small samples and selection bias. This 
study was conducted to assess the reliability of experts in identifying IIIC.
: This prospective analysis included 30 experts with subspecialty 
clinical neurophysiology training from 18 institutions. Experts independently 
scored varying numbers of ten-second EEG segments as: "Seizure (SZ)", 
"Lateralized Periodic Discharges (LPD)", "Generalized Periodic Discharges 
(GPD)", "Lateralized Rhythmic Delta Activity (LRDA)", "Generalized Rhythmic 
Delta Activity (GRDA)", or "Other". EEGs were performed for clinical indications 
at Massachusetts General Hospital between 2006 to 2020. Primary outcome measures 
were pairwise IRR (average percent agreement (PA) between pairs of experts) and 
majority IRR (average PA with group consensus) for each class; and beyond chance 
agreement (κ). Secondary outcomes were calibration of expert scoring to group 
consensus, and latent trait analysis to investigate contributions of bias and 
noise to scoring variability.
RESULTS: Among 2,711 EEGs, 49% were from females, and median (IQR) age was 55 
(41). In total experts scored 50,697 EEG segments; the median [range] number 
scored by each expert was 6,287.5 [1,002, 45,267]. Overall pairwise IRR was 
moderate (PA 52%, κ 42%), and majority IRR was substantial (PA 65%, κ 61%). 
Noise-bias analysis demonstrated that a single underlying receiver operating 
curve can account for most variation in experts' false positive vs true positive 
characteristics (median [range] of variance explained (R 2): 95 [93, 98]%), and 
for most variation in experts' precision vs sensitivity characteristics (R 2: 75 
[59, 89]%). Thus, variation between experts is mostly attributable not to 
differences in expertise, but rather to variation in decision thresholds.
DISCUSSION: Our results provide precise estimates of expert reliability from a 
large and diverse sample, and a parsimonious theory to explain the origin of 
disagreements between experts. The results also establish a standard for how 
well an automated IIIC classifier must perform to match experts.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that 
independent expert review reliably identifies ictal-interictal injury continuum 
patterns on EEG compared to expert consensus.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Sleep-disordered breathing is a significant risk factor for 
cardiometabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. High loop gain (HLG) is a 
driving mechanism of central sleep apnea or periodic breathing. This study 
presents a computational approach that identifies "expressed/manifest" HLG via a 
cyclical self-similarity feature in effort-based respiration signals.
: Working under the assumption that HLG increases the risk of residual 
central respiratory events during continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), 
the full night similarity, computed during diagnostic non-CPAP polysomnography 
(PSG), was used to predict residual central events during CPAP (REC), which we 
defined as central apnea index (CAI) higher than 10. Central apnea labels are 
obtained both from manual scoring by sleep technologists and from an automated 
algorithm developed for this study. The Massachusetts General Hospital sleep 
database was used, including 2466 PSG pairs of diagnostic and CPAP titration PSG 
recordings.
RESULTS: Diagnostic CAI based on technologist labels predicted REC with an area 
under the curve (AUC) of 0.82 ± 0.03. Based on automatically generated labels, 
the combination of full night similarity and automatically generated CAI 
resulted in an AUC of 0.85 ± 0.02. A subanalysis was performed on a population 
with technologist-labeled diagnostic CAI higher than 5. Full night similarity 
predicted REC with an AUC of 0.57 ± 0.07 for manual and 0.65 ± 0.06 for 
automated labels.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed self-similarity feature, as a surrogate estimate of 
expressed respiratory HLG and computed from easily accessible effort signals, 
can detect periodic breathing regardless of admixed obstructive features such as 
flow limitation and can aid the prediction of REC.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess the variability in EEG reactivity 
evaluation practices during cardiac arrest prognostication.
: A survey of institutional representatives from North American academic 
hospitals participating in the Critical Care EEG Monitoring Research Consortium 
was conducted to assess practice patterns involving EEG reactivity evaluation. 
This 10-question multiple-choice survey evaluated metrics related to technical, 
interpretation, personnel, and procedural aspects of bedside EEG reactivity 
testing and interpretation specific to cardiac arrest prognostication. One 
response per hospital was obtained.
RESULTS: Responses were received from 25 hospitals, including 7 pediatric 
hospitals. A standardized EEG reactivity protocol was available in 44% of 
centers. Sixty percent of respondents believed that reactivity interpretation 
was subjective. Reactivity bedside testing always (100%) started during 
hypothermia and was performed daily during monitoring in the majority (71%) of 
hospitals. Stimulation was performed primarily by neurodiagnostic technologists 
(76%). The mean number of activation procedures modalities tested was 4.5 (SD 
2.1). The most commonly used activation procedures were auditory (83.3%), nail 
bed pressure (63%), and light tactile stimuli (63%). Changes in EEG amplitude 
alone were not considered consistent with EEG reactivity in 21% of centers.
CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial variability in EEG reactivity evaluation 
practices during cardiac arrest prognostication among North American academic 
hospitals. Efforts are needed to standardize protocols and nomenclature 
according with national guidelines and promote best practices in EEG reactivity 
evaluation.

BACKGROUD: Using electronic health data, we sought to identify clinical and 
physiological parameters that in combination predict neurologic outcomes after 
aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH).
: We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study of patients 
admitted with aSAH between 2011 and 2016. A set of 473 predictor variables was 
evaluated. Our outcome measure was discharge Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). For 
laboratory and physiological data, we computed the minimum, maximum, median, and 
variance for the first three admission days. We created a penalized logistic 
regression model to determine predictors of outcome and a multivariate 
multilevel prediction model to predict poor (GOS 1-2), intermediate (GOS 3), or 
good (GOS 4-5) outcomes.
RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-three patients met inclusion criteria; most were 
discharged with a GOS of 3. Multivariate analysis predictors of mortality (AUC 
0.9198) included APACHE II score, Glasgow Come Scale (GCS), white blood cell 
(WBC) count, mean arterial pressure, variance of serum glucose, intracranial 
pressure (ICP), and serum sodium. Predictors of death/dependence versus 
independence (GOS 4-5)(AUC 0.9456) were levetiracetam, mechanical ventilation, 
WBC count, heart rate, ICP variance, GCS, APACHE II, and epileptiform 
discharges. The multiclass prediction model selected GCS, admission APACHE II, 
periodic discharges, lacosamide, and rebleeding as significant predictors; model 
performance exceeded 80% accuracy in predicting poor or good outcome and 
exceeded 70% accuracy for predicting intermediate outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Variance in early physiologic data can impact patient outcomes and 
may serve as targets for early goal-directed therapy. Electronically retrievable 
features such as ICP, glucose levels, and electroencephalography patterns should 
be considered in disease severity and risk stratification scores.

Objectives: Patients with comorbidities are at increased risk for poor outcomes 
in COVID-19, yet data on patients with prior neurological disease remains 
limited. Our objective was to determine the odds of critical illness and 
duration of mechanical ventilation in patients with prior cerebrovascular 
disease and COVID-19. : A observational study of 1,128 consecutive adult 
patients admitted to an academic center in Boston, Massachusetts, and diagnosed 
with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We tested the association between prior 
cerebrovascular disease and critical illness, defined as mechanical ventilation 
(MV) or death by day 28, using logistic regression with inverse probability 
weighting of the propensity score. Among intubated patients, we estimated the 
cumulative incidence of successful extubation without death over 45 days using 
 risk analysis. Results: Of the 1,128 adults with COVID-19, 350 (36%) 
were critically ill by day 28. The median age of patients was 59 years (SD: 18 
years) and 640 (57%) were men. As of June 2nd, 2020, 127 (11%) patients had 
died. A total of 177 patients (16%) had a prior cerebrovascular disease. Prior 
cerebrovascular disease was significantly associated with critical illness (OR = 
1.54, 95% CI = 1.14-2.07), lower rate of successful extubation (cause-specific 
HR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.33-0.98), and increased duration of intubation (restricted 
mean time difference = 4.02 days, 95% CI = 0.34-10.92) compared to patients 
without cerebrovascular disease. Interpretation: Prior cerebrovascular disease 
adversely affects COVID-19 outcomes in hospitalized patients. Further study is 
required to determine if this subpopulation requires closer monitoring for 
disease progression during COVID-19.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We examined the impact of 3 anticonvulsant prophylaxis 
strategies on quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) among patients with an 
incident acute ischemic stroke.
: We created a decision tree to evaluate 3 strategies:  long-term 
primary prophylaxis; (2) short-term secondary prophylaxis after an early seizure 
with lifetime prophylaxis if persistent or late seizures (LSs) developed; and 
(3) long-term secondary prophylaxis if either early, late, or persistent 
seizures developed. The outcome was quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALY). We 
created 4 base cases to simulate common clinical scenarios:  female patient 
aged 40 years with a 2% or 11% lifetime risk of an LS and a 33% lifetime risk of 
an adverse drug reaction (ADR); (2) male patient aged 65 years with a 6% or 29% 
LS risk and 60% ADR risk; (3) male patient aged 50 years with an 18% or 65% LS 
risk and 33% ADR risk; and (4) female patient aged 80 years with a 29% or 83% LS 
risk and 80% ADR risk. In sensitivity analyses, we altered the parameters and 
assumptions.
RESULTS: Across all 4 base cases, primary prophylaxis yielded the fewest QALYs 
when compared with secondary prophylaxis. For example, under scenario 1, 
strategies 2 and 3 resulted in 7.17 QALYs each, but strategy 1 yielded only 6.91 
QALYs. Under scenario 4, strategies 2 and 3 yielded 2.85 QALYs compared with 
1.40 QALYs for strategy 1. Under scenarios in which patients had higher ADR 
risks, strategy 2 led to the most QALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: Short-term therapy with continued anticonvulsant prophylaxis only 
after postischemic stroke seizures arise dominates lifetime primary prophylaxis 
in all scenarios examined. Our findings reinforce the necessity of close 
follow-up and discontinuation of anticonvulsant seizure prophylaxis started 
during acute ischemic stroke hospitalization.

IMPORTANCE: Dementia is an increasing cause of disability and loss of 
independence in the elderly population yet remains largely underdiagnosed. A 
biomarker for dementia that can identify individuals with or at risk for 
developing dementia may help close this diagnostic gap.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between a sleep 
electroencephalography-based brain age index (BAI), the difference between 
chronological age and brain age estimated using the sleep electroencephalogram, 
and dementia.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this retrospective cross-sectional study 
of 9834 polysomnograms, BAI was computed among individuals with previously 
determined dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or cognitive symptoms but 
no diagnosis of MCI or dementia, and among healthy individuals without dementia 
from August 22, 2008, to June 4, 2018. Data were analyzed from November 15, 
2018, to June 24, 2020.
EXPOSURE: Dementia, MCI, and dementia-related symptoms, such as cognitive change 
and memory impairment.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The outcome measures were the trend in BAI when 
moving from groups ranging from healthy, to symptomatic, to MCI, to dementia and 
pairwise comparisons of BAI among these groups.
FINDINGS: A total of 5144 sleep studies were included in BAI examinations. 
Patients in these studies had a median (interquartile range) age of 54 (43-65) 
years, and 3026 (59%) were men. The patients included 88 with dementia, 44 with 
MCI, 1075 who were symptomatic, and 2336 without dementia. There was a monotonic 
increase in mean (SE) BAI from the nondementia group to the dementia group 
(nondementia: 0.20 [0.42]; symptomatic: 0.58 [0.41]; MCI: 1.65 [1.20]; dementia: 
4.18 [1.02]; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that a sleep-state 
electroencephalography-based BAI shows promise as a biomarker associated with 
progressive brain processes that ultimately result in dementia.

Polysomnography remains the cornerstone of objective testing in sleep medicine 
and results in massive amounts of electrophysiological data, which is 
well-suited for analysis with artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools. Combined 
with other sources of health data, AI is expected to provide new insights to 
inform the clinical care of sleep disorders and advance our understanding of the 
integral role sleep plays in human health. Additionally, AI has the potential to 
streamline day-to-day operations and therefore optimize direct patient care by 
the sleep disorders team. However, clinicians, scientists, and other 
stakeholders must develop best practices to integrate this rapidly evolving 
technology into our daily work while maintaining the highest degree of quality 
and transparency in health care and research. Ultimately, when harnessed 
appropriately in conjunction with human expertise, AI will improve the practice 
of sleep medicine and further sleep science for the health and well-being of our 
patients.

Robust control of burst suppression for medical coma.

Westover MB, Kim SE, Ching S, Purdon PL, Brown EN.

Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.

OBJECTIVE: Medical coma is an anesthetic-induced state of brain inactivation, 
manifest in the electroencephalogram by burst suppression. Feedback control can 
be used to regulate burst suppression, however, previous designs have not been 
robust. Robust control design is critical under real-world operating conditions, 
subject to substantial pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameter uncertainty 
and unpredictable external disturbances. We sought to develop a robust 
closed-loop anesthesia delivery (CLAD) system to control medical coma.
APPROACH: We developed a robust CLAD system to control the burst suppression 
probability (BSP). We developed a novel BSP tracking algorithm based on 
realistic models of propofol pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. We also 
developed a practical method for estimating patient-specific pharmacodynamics 
parameters. Finally, we synthesized a robust proportional integral controller. 
Using a factorial design spanning patient age, mass, height, and gender, we 
tested whether the system performed within clinically acceptable limits. 
Throughout all experiments we subjected the system to disturbances, simulating 
treatment of refractory status epilepticus in a real-world intensive care unit 
environment.
MAIN RESULTS: In 5400 simulations, CLAD behavior remained within specifications. 
Transient behavior after a step in target BSP from 0.2 to 0.8 exhibited a rise 
time (the median (min, max)) of 1.4 [1.1, 1.9] min; settling time, 7.8 [4.2, 
9.0] min; and percent overshoot of 9.6 [2.3, 10.8]%. Under steady state 
conditions the CLAD system exhibited a median error of 0.1 [-0.5, 0.9]%; 
inaccuracy of 1.8 [0.9, 3.4]%; oscillation index of 1.8 [0.9, 3.4]%; and maximum 
instantaneous propofol dose of 4.3 [2.1, 10.5] mg kg(-1). The maximum hourly 
propofol dose was 4.3 [2.1, 10.3] mg kg(-1) h(-1). Performance fell within 
clinically acceptable limits for all measures.
SIGNIFICANCE: A CLAD system designed using robust control theory achieves 
clinically acceptable performance in the presence of realistic unmodeled 
disturbances and in spite of realistic model uncertainty, while maintaining 
infusion rates within acceptable safety limits.

PURPOSE: The rapid expansion of the use of continuous critical care 
electroencephalogram (cEEG) monitoring and resulting multicenter research 
studies through the Critical Care EEG Monitoring Research Consortium has created 
the need for a collaborative data sharing mechanism and repository. The s 
describe the development of a research database incorporating the American 
Clinical Neurophysiology Society standardized terminology for critical care EEG 
monitoring. The database includes flexible report generation tools that allow 
for daily clinical use.
: Key clinical and research variables were incorporated into a Microsoft 
Access database. To assess its utility for multicenter research data collection, 
the s performed a 21-center feasibility study in which each center entered 
data from 12 consecutive intensive care unit monitoring patients. To assess its 
utility as a clinical report generating tool, three large volume centers used it 
to generate daily clinical critical care EEG reports.
RESULTS: A total of 280 subjects were enrolled in the multicenter feasibility 
study. The duration of recording (median, 25.5 hours) varied significantly 
between the centers. The incidence of seizure (17.6%), periodic/rhythmic 
discharges (35.7%), and interictal epileptiform discharges (11.8%) was similar 
to previous studies. The database was used as a clinical reporting tool by 3 
centers that entered a total of 3,144 unique patients covering 6,665 recording 
days.
CONCLUSIONS: The Critical Care EEG Monitoring Research Consortium database has 
been successfully developed and implemented with a dual role as a collaborative 
research platform and a clinical reporting tool. It is now available for public 
download to be used as a clinical data repository and report generating tool.

The elderly population faces an increasing number of cases of chronic 
neurological conditions, such as epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease. Because the 
elderly with epilepsy are commonly excluded from randomized controlled clinical 
trials, there are few rigorous studies to guide clinical practice. When the 
elderly are eligible for trials, they either rarely participate or frequently 
have poor adherence to therapy, thus limiting both generalizability and 
validity. In contrast, large observational data sets are increasingly available, 
but are susceptible to bias when using common analytic approaches. Recent 
developments in causal inference-analytic approaches also introduce the 
possibility of emulating randomized controlled trials to yield valid estimates. 
We provide a practical example of the application of the principles of causal 
inference to a large observational data set of patients with epilepsy. This 
review also provides a framework for comparative-effectiveness research in 
chronic neurological conditions.

OBJECTIVE: To identify whether abnormal neural activity, in the form of 
epileptiform discharges and rhythmic or periodic activity, which we term here 
ictal-interictal continuum abnormalities (IICAs), are associated with delayed 
cerebral ischemia (DCI).
: Retrospective analysis of continuous electroencephalography (cEEG) 
reports and medical records from 124 patients with moderate to severe grade 
subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). We identified daily occurrence of seizures and 
IICAs. Using survival analysis , we estimated the cumulative probability 
of IICA onset time for patients with and without delayed cerebral ischemia 
(DCI).
RESULTS: Our data suggest the presence of IICAs indeed increases the risk of 
developing DCI, especially when they begin several days after the onset of SAH. 
We found that all IICA types except generalized rhythmic delta activity occur 
more commonly in patients who develop DCI. In particular, IICAs that begin later 
in hospitalization correlate with increased risk of DCI.
CONCLUSIONS: IICAs represent a new marker for identifying early patients at 
increased risk for DCI. Moreover, IICAs might contribute mechanistically to DCI 
and therefore represent a new potential target for intervention to prevent 
secondary cerebral injury following SAH.
SIGNIFICANCE: These findings imply that IICAs may be a novel marker for 
predicting those at higher risk for DCI development.

OBJECTIVE: Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is a common, disabling complication 
of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Preventing DCI is a key focus of neurocritical 
care, but interventions carry risk and cannot be applied indiscriminately. 
Although retrospective studies have identified continuous 
electroencephalographic (cEEG) measures associated with DCI, no study has 
characterized the accuracy of cEEG with sufficient rigor to justify using it to 
triage patients to interventions or clinical trials. We therefore prospectively 
assessed the accuracy of cEEG for predicting DCI, following the Standards for 
Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy Studies.
: We prospectively performed cEEG in nontraumatic, high-grade SAH 
patients at a single institution. The index test consisted of clinical 
neurophysiologists prospectively reporting prespecified EEG alarms:  
decreasing relative alpha variability, (2) decreasing alpha-delta ratio, (3) 
worsening focal slowing, or (4) late appearing epileptiform abnormalities. The 
diagnostic reference standard was DCI determined by blinded, adjudicated review. 
Primary outcome measures were sensitivity and specificity of cEEG for subsequent 
DCI, determined by multistate survival analysis, adjusted for baseline risk.
RESULTS: One hundred three of 227 consecutive patients were eligible and 
underwent cEEG monitoring (7.7-day mean duration). EEG alarms occurred in 96.2% 
of patients with and 19.6% without subsequent DCI (1.9-day median latency, 
interquartile range = 0.9-4.1). Among alarm subtypes, late onset epileptiform 
abnormalities had the highest predictive value. Prespecified EEG findings 
predicted DCI among patients with low (91% sensitivity, 83% specificity) and 
high (95% sensitivity, 77% specificity) baseline risk.
INTERPRETATION: cEEG accurately predicts DCI following SAH and may help target 
therapies to patients at highest risk of secondary brain injury. Ann Neurol

IMPORTANCE: The validity of using electroencephalograms (EEGs) to diagnose 
epilepsy requires reliable detection of interictal epileptiform discharges 
(IEDs). Prior interrater reliability (IRR) studies are limited by small samples 
and selection bias.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the reliability of experts in detecting IEDs in routine 
EEGs.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective analysis conducted in 2 
phases included as participants physicians with at least 1 year of subspecialty 
training in clinical neurophysiology. In phase 1, 9 experts independently 
identified candidate IEDs in 991 EEGs (1 expert per EEG) reported in the medical 
record to contain at least 1 IED, yielding 87 636 candidate IEDs. In phase 2, 
the candidate IEDs were clustered into groups with distinct morphological 
features, yielding 12 602 clusters, and a representative candidate IED was 
selected from each cluster. We added 660 waveforms (11 random samples each from 
60 randomly selected EEGs reported as being free of IEDs) as negative controls. 
Eight experts independently scored all 13 262 candidates as IEDs or non-IEDs. 
The 1051 EEGs in the study were recorded at the Massachusetts General Hospital 
between 2012 and 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome measures were percentage of 
agreement (PA) and beyond-chance agreement (Gwet κ) for individual IEDs 
(IED-wise IRR) and for whether an EEG contained any IEDs (EEG-wise IRR). 
Secondary outcomes were the correlations between numbers of IEDs marked by 
experts across cases, calibration of expert scoring to group consensus, and 
receiver operating characteristic analysis of how well multivariate logistic 
regression models may account for differences in the IED scoring behavior 
between experts.
RESULTS: Among the 1051 EEGs assessed in the study, 540 (51.4%) were those of 
females and 511 (48.6%) were those of males. In phase 1, 9 experts each marked 
potential IEDs in a median of 65 (interquartile range [IQR], 28-332) EEGs. The 
total number of IED candidates marked was 87 636. Expert IRR for the 13 262 
individually annotated IED candidates was fair, with the mean PA being 72.4% 
(95% CI, 67.0%-77.8%) and mean κ being 48.7% (95% CI, 37.3%-60.1%). The EEG-wise 
IRR was substantial, with the mean PA being 80.9% (95% CI, 76.2%-85.7%) and mean 
κ being 69.4% (95% CI, 60.3%-78.5%). A statistical model based on waveform 
morphological features, when provided with individualized thresholds, explained 
the median binary scores of all experts with a high degree of accuracy of 80% 
(range, 73%-88%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study's findings suggest that experts can 
identify whether EEGs contain IEDs with substantial reliability. Lower 
reliability regarding individual IEDs may be largely explained by various 
experts applying different thresholds to a common underlying statistical model.

In recent years there has been an explosion of research evaluating resting-state 
brain functional connectivity (FC) using different modalities. However, the 
relationship between such measures of FC and the underlying causal brain 
interactions has not been well characterized. To further characterize this 
relationship, we assessed the relationship between electroencephalography (EEG) 
resting state FC and propagation of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) 
evoked potentials (TEPs) at the sensor and source level in healthy participants. 
TMS was applied to six different cortical regions in ten healthy individuals (9 
male; 1 female), and effects on brain activity were measured using simultaneous 
EEG. Pre-stimulus FC was assessed using five different FC measures (Pearson's 
correlation, mutual information, weighted phase lag index, coherence and phase 
locking value). Propagation of the TEPs was quantified as the root mean square 
(RMS) of the TEP voltage and current source density (CSD) at the sensor and 
source level, respectively. The relationship between pre-stimulus FC and the 
spatial distribution of TEP activity was determined using a generalized linear 
model (GLM) analysis. On the group level, all FC measures correlated 
significantly with TEP activity over the early (15-75 ms) and full range 
(15-400 ms) of the TEP at the sensor and source level. However, the predictive 
value of all FC measures is quite limited, accounting for less than 10% of the 
variance of TEP activity, and varies substantially across participants and 
stimulation sites. Taken together, these results suggest that EEG functional 
connectivity studies in sensor and source space should be interpreted with 
caution.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the sensitivity of quantitative EEG (QEEG) for 
electrographic seizure identification in the intensive care unit (ICU).
: Six-hour EEG epochs chosen from 15 patients underwent transformation 
into QEEG displays. Each epoch was reviewed in 3 formats: raw EEG, QEEG + raw, 
and QEEG-only. Epochs were also analyzed by a proprietary seizure detection 
algorithm. Nine neurophysiologists reviewed raw EEGs to identify seizures to 
serve as the gold standard. Nine other neurophysiologists with experience in 
QEEG evaluated the epochs in QEEG formats, with and without concomitant raw EEG. 
Sensitivity and false-positive rates (FPRs) for seizure identification were 
calculated and median review time assessed.
RESULTS: Mean sensitivity for seizure identification ranged from 51% to 67% for 
QEEG-only and 63%-68% for QEEG + raw. FPRs averaged 1/h for QEEG-only and 0.5/h 
for QEEG + raw. Mean sensitivity of seizure probability software was 
26.2%-26.7%, with FPR of 0.07/h. Epochs with the highest sensitivities contained 
frequent, intermittent seizures. Lower sensitivities were seen with 
slow-frequency, low-amplitude seizures and epochs with rhythmic or periodic 
patterns. Median review times were shorter for QEEG (6 minutes) and QEEG + raw 
analysis (14.5 minutes) vs raw EEG (19 minutes; p = 0.00003).
CONCLUSIONS: A panel of QEEG trends can be used by experts to shorten EEG review 
time for seizure identification with reasonable sensitivity and low FPRs. The 
prevalence of false detections confirms that raw EEG review must be used in 
conjunction with QEEG. Studies are needed to identify optimal QEEG trend 
configurations and the utility of QEEG as a screening tool for non-EEG 
personnel.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE REVIEW: This study provides Class II evidence that 
QEEG + raw interpreted by experts identifies seizures in patients in the ICU 
with a sensitivity of 63%-68% and FPR of 0.5 seizures per hour.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, it has become increasingly apparent that 
characterizing individual brain structure, connectivity and dynamics is 
essential for understanding brain function in health and disease. However, the 
majority of neuroimaging and brain stimulation research has characterized human 
brain function by averaging measurements from groups of subjects and providing 
population-level inferences. External perturbations applied directly to 
well-defined brain regions can reveal distinctive information about the state, 
connectivity and dynamics of the human brain at the individual level.
OBJECTIVES: In a series of studies, we aimed to characterize individual brain 
responses to MRI-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and explore the 
reproducibility of the evoked effects, differences between brain regions, and 
their individual specificity.
: In the first study, we administered single pulses of TMS to both 
anatomically (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex- 'L-DLPFC', left 
Intra-parietal lobule- 'L-IPL) and functionally (left motor cortex- 'L-M1', 
right default mode network- 'R-DMN, right dorsal attention network- 'R-DAN') 
defined cortical nodes in the frontal, motor, and parietal regions across two 
identical sessions spaced one month apart in 24 healthy volunteers. In the 
second study, we extended our analyses to two independent data sets (n = 10 in 
both data sets) having different sham-TMS protocols.
RESULTS: In the first study, we found that perturbation-induced cortical 
propagation patterns are heterogeneous across individuals but highly 
reproducible within individuals, specific to the stimulated region, and distinct 
from spontaneous activity. Most importantly, we demonstrate that by assessing 
the spatiotemporal characteristics of TMS-induced brain responses originating 
from different cortical regions, individual subjects can be identified with 
perfect accuracy. In the second study, we demonstrated that subject specificity 
of TEPs is generalizable across independent data sets and distinct from 
non-transcranial neural responses evoked by sham-TMS protocols.
CONCLUSIONS: Perturbation-induced brain responses reveal unique "brain 
fingerprints" that reflect causal connectivity dynamics of the stimulated brain 
regions, and may serve as reliable biomarkers of individual brain function.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent and treatable disorder of 
neurological and medical importance that is traditionally diagnosed through 
multi-channel laboratory polysomnography(PSG). However, OSA testing is 
increasingly performed with portable home devices using limited physiological 
channels. We tested the hypothesis that single channel respiratory effort alone 
could support automated quantification of apnea and hypopnea events. We 
developed a respiratory event detection algorithm applied to thoracic 
strain-belt data from patients with variable degrees of sleep apnea. We 
optimized parameters on a training set (n=57) and then tested performance on a 
validation set (n=59). The optimized algorithm correlated significantly with 
manual scoring in the validation set (R2=0.73 for training set, R2=0.55 for 
validation set; p<0.05). For dichotomous classification, the AUC was >0.92 and 
>0.85 using apnea-hypopnea index cutoff values of 5 and 15, respectively. Our 
findings demonstrate that manually scored AHI values can be approximated from 
thoracic movements alone. This finding has potential applications for automating 
laboratory PSG analysis as well as improving the performance of limited channel 
home monitors.

Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.

OBJECTIVE: Many forms of epilepsy are associated with aberrant neuronal 
connections, but the relationship between such pathological connectivity and the 
underlying physiological predisposition to seizures is unclear. We sought to 
characterize the cortical excitability profile of a developmental form of 
epilepsy known to have structural and functional connectivity abnormalities.
: We employed transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with simultaneous 
electroencephalographic (EEG) recording in 8 patients with epilepsy from 
periventricular nodular heterotopia and matched healthy controls. We used 
connectivity imaging findings to guide TMS targeting and compared the evoked 
responses to single-pulse stimulation from different cortical regions.
RESULTS: Heterotopia patients with active epilepsy demonstrated a relatively 
augmented late cortical response that was greater than that of matched controls. 
This abnormality was specific to cortical regions with connectivity to 
subcortical heterotopic gray matter. Topographic mapping of the late response 
differences showed distributed cortical networks that were not limited to the 
stimulation site, and source analysis in 1 subject revealed that the generator 
of abnormal TMS-evoked activity overlapped with the spike and seizure onset 
zone.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that patients with epilepsy from gray 
matter heterotopia have altered cortical physiology consistent with 
hyperexcitability, and that this abnormality is specifically linked to the 
presence of aberrant connectivity. These results support the idea that TMS-EEG 
could be a useful biomarker in epilepsy in gray matter heterotopia, expand our 
understanding of circuit mechanisms of epileptogenesis, and have potential 
implications for therapeutic neuromodulation in similar epileptic conditions 
associated with deep lesions.

Patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) are at high risk of morbidity and 
mortality, yet their referral to specialist care is frequently delayed. The 
ability to identify patients at high risk of DRE at the time of treatment 
initiation, and to subsequently steer their treatment pathway toward more 
personalized interventions, has high clinical utility. Here, we aim to 
demonstrate the feasibility of developing algorithms for predicting DRE using 
machine learning . Longitudinal, intersected data sourced from US 
pharmacy, medical, and adjudicated hospital claims from 1,376,756 patients from 
2006 to 2015 were analyzed; 292,892 met inclusion criteria for epilepsy, and 
38,382 were classified as having DRE using a proxy measure for drug resistance. 
Patients were characterized using 1270 features reflecting demographics, 
comorbidities, medications, procedures, epilepsy status, and payer status. Data 
from 175,735 randomly selected patients were used to train three algorithms and 
from the remainder to assess the trained models' predictive power. A model with 
only age and sex was used as a benchmark. The best model, random forest, 
achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (95% 
confidence interval [CI]) of 0.764 (0.759, 0.770), compared with 0.657 (0.651, 
0.663) for the benchmark model. Moreover, predicted probabilities for DRE were 
well-calibrated with the observed frequencies in the data. The model predicted 
drug resistance approximately 2 years before patients in the test dataset had 
failed two antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Machine learning models constructed using 
claims data predicted which patients are likely to fail ≥3 AEDs and are at risk 
of developing DRE at the time of the first AED prescription. The use of such 
models can ensure that patients with predicted DRE receive specialist care with 
potentially more aggressive therapeutic interventions from diagnosis, to help 
reduce the serious sequelae of DRE.

Aggressive treatment of status epilepticus with anesthetic drugs can provide 
rapid seizure control, but it might lead to serious medical complications and 
worse outcomes. Using a decision analysis approach, this concise review provides 
a framework for individualized decision making about aggressive and 
nonaggressive treatment in status epilepticus. The s propose and review 
the most relevant parameters guiding the risk-benefit analysis of treatment 
aggressiveness in status epilepticus and present real-world-based case examples 
to illustrate how these tools could be used at the bedside and serve to guide 
future research in refractory status epilepticus treatment.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Sleep is reflected not only in the electroencephalogram but 
also in heart rhythms and breathing patterns. We hypothesized that it is 
possible to accurately stage sleep based on the electrocardiogram (ECG) and 
respiratory signals.
: Using a dataset including 8682 polysomnograms, we develop deep neural 
networks to stage sleep from ECG and respiratory signals. Five deep neural 
networks consisting of convolutional networks and long- and short-term memory 
networks are trained to stage sleep using heart and breathing, including the 
timing of R peaks from ECG, abdominal and chest respiratory effort, and the 
combinations of these signals.
RESULTS: ECG in combination with the abdominal respiratory effort achieved the 
best performance for staging all five sleep stages with a Cohen's kappa of 0.585 
(95% confidence interval ±0.017); and 0.760 (±0.019) for discriminating awake 
vs. rapid eye movement vs. nonrapid eye movement sleep. Performance is better 
for younger ages, whereas it is robust for body mass index, apnea severity, and 
commonly used outpatient medications.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results validate that ECG and respiratory effort provide 
substantial information about sleep stages in a large heterogeneous population. 
This opens new possibilities in sleep research and applications where 
electroencephalography is not readily available or may be infeasible.

The information theoretic perspective on medical diagnostic inference.

Eiseman NA, Bianchi MT, Westover MB.

 information:
Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.

The goal of this work is to present information theory, specifically Claude 
Shannon's mathematical theory of communication, in a clinical context and 
elucidate its potential contributions to understanding the process of diagnostic 
inference. We use probability theory, information theory, and clinical examples 
to develop information theory as a means to examine uncertainty in diagnostic 
testing situations. We begin our discussion with a brief review of probability 
theory as it relates to diagnostic testing. An outline of Shannon's theory of 
communication theory and how it directly translates to the medical diagnostic 
process serves as the essential justification for this article. Finally, we 
introduce the mathematical tools of information theory that allow for an 
understanding of diagnostic uncertainty and test effectiveness in a variety of 
contexts. We show that information theory provides a quantitative framework for 
understanding uncertainty that readily extends to medical diagnostic contexts.

Models of memory consolidation posit a central role for reactivation of brain 
activity patterns during sleep, especially in non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) 
sleep. While such "replay" of recent waking experiences has been 
well-demonstrated in rodents, electrophysiological evidence of reactivation in 
human sleep is still largely lacking. In this intracranial study in patients 
with epilepsy (N = 9) we explored the spontaneous electroencephalographic 
reactivation during sleep of spatial patterns of brain activity evoked by motor 
learning. We first extracted the gamma-band (60-140 Hz) patterns underlying 
finger movements during a tapping task and underlying no-movement during a short 
rest period just prior to the task, and trained a binary classifier to 
discriminate between motor movements vs. rest. We then used the trained model on 
NREM sleep data immediately after the task and on NREM sleep during a control 
sleep period preceding the task. Compared with the control sleep period, we 
found, at the subject level, an increase in the detection rate of motor-related 
patterns during sleep following the task, but without association with 
performance changes. These data provide electrophysiological support for the 
reoccurrence in NREM sleep of the neural activity related to previous waking 
experience, i.e. that a basic tenet of the reactivation theory does occur in 
human sleep.

No clear evidence-based treatment paradigm currently exists for refractory and 
super-refractory status epilepticus, which can result in significant mortality 
and morbidity. While patients are typically treated with antiepileptic drugs and 
anesthetics, neurosurgical neuromodulation techniques can also be considered. We 
present a novel case in which responsive neurostimulation was used to 
effectively treat a patient who had developed super-refractory status 
epilepticus, later consistent with epilepsia partialis continua, that was 
refractory to antiepileptic drugs, immunomodulatory therapies, and transcranial 
magnetic stimulation. This case demonstrates how regional therapy provided by 
responsive neurostimulation can be effective in treating super-refractory status 
epilepticus through neuromodulation of seizure networks.

The impact of body posture and sleep stages on sleep apnea severity in adults.

Eiseman NA, Westover MB, Ellenbogen JM, Bianchi MT.

 information:
Neurology Department, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Determining the presence and severity of obstructive sleep 
apnea (OSA) is based on apnea and hypopnea event rates per hour of sleep. Making 
this determination presents a diagnostic challenge, given that summary metrics 
do not consider certain factors that influence severity, such as body position 
and the composition of sleep stages.
: We retrospectively analyzed 300 consecutive diagnostic PSGs performed 
at our center to determine the impact of body position and sleep stage on sleep 
apnea severity.
RESULTS: The median percent of REM sleep was 16% (reduced compared to a normal 
value of ~25%). The median percent supine sleep was 65%. Fewer than half of PSGs 
contained > 10 min in each of the 4 possible combinations of REM/NREM and 
supine/non-supine. Half of patients had > 2-fold worsening of the apnea-hypopnea 
index (AHI) in REM sleep, and 60% had > 2-fold worsening of AHI while supine. 
Adjusting for body position had greater impact on the AHI than adjusting for 
reduced REM%. Misclassification--specifically underestimation of OSA 
severity--is attributed more commonly to body position (20% to 40%) than to 
sleep stage (~10%).
CONCLUSIONS: Supine-dominance and REM-dominance commonly contribute to AHI 
underestimation in single-night PSGs. Misclassification of OSA severity can be 
mitigated in a patient-specific manner by appropriate consideration of these 
variables. The results have implications for the interpretation of single-night 
measurements in clinical practice, especially with trends toward home testing 
devices that may not measure body position or sleep stage.

PURPOSE: Up to one third of epilepsy patients develop pharmacoresistant seizures 
and many benefit from resective surgery. However, patients with non-lesional 
focal epilepsy often require intracranial monitoring to localize the seizure 
focus. Intracranial monitoring carries operative morbidity risk and does not 
always succeed in localizing the seizures, making the benefit of this approach 
less certain. We performed a decision analysis comparing three strategies for 
patients with non-lesional focal epilepsy:  intracranial monitoring, (2) 
vagal nerve stimulator (VNS) implantation and (3) medical management to 
determine which strategy maximizes the expected quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) for our base cases.
METHOD: We constructed two base cases using parameters reported in the medical 
literature:  a young, otherwise healthy patient and (2) an elderly, otherwise 
healthy patient. We constructed a decision tree comprising strategies for the 
treatment of non-lesional epilepsy and two clinical outcomes: seizure freedom 
and no seizure freedom. Sensitivity analyses of probabilities at each branch 
were guided by data from the medical literature to define decision thresholds 
across plausible parameter ranges.
RESULTS: Intracranial monitoring maximizes the expected QALYs for both base 
cases. The sensitivity analyses provide estimates of the values of key 
variables, such as the surgical risk or the chance of localizing the focus, at 
which intracranial monitoring is no longer favored.
CONCLUSION: Intracranial monitoring is favored over VNS and medical management 
in young and elderly patients over a wide, clinically-relevant range of 
pertinent model variables such as the chance of localizing the seizure focus and 
the surgical morbidity rate.

BACKGROUND: Following non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), in-hospital 
delayed cerebral ischemia is predicted by two chief events on continuous EEG 
(cEEG): new or worsening epileptiform abnormalities (EAs) and deterioration of 
cEEG background frequencies. We evaluated the association between longitudinal 
outcomes and these cEEG biomarkers. We additionally evaluated the association 
between longitudinal outcomes and other in-hospital complications.
: Patients with nontraumatic SAH undergoing ≥ 3 days of cEEG monitoring 
were enrolled in a prospective study evaluating longitudinal outcomes. Modified 
Rankin Scale (mRS) was assessed at discharge, and at 3- and 6-month follow-up 
time points. Adjusting for baseline severity in a cumulative proportional odds 
model, we modeled the mRS ordinally and measured the association between mRS and 
two forms of in-hospital cEEG deterioration:  cEEG evidence of new or 
worsening epileptiform abnormalities and (2) cEEG evidence of new background 
deterioration. We compared the magnitude of these associations at each time 
point with the association between mRS and other in-hospital complications:  
delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), (2) hospital-acquired infections (HAI), and (3) 
hydrocephalus. In a secondary analysis, we employed a linear mixed effects model 
to examine the association of mRS over time (dichotomized as 0-3 vs. 4-6) with 
both biomarkers of cEEG deterioration and with other in-hospital complications.
RESULTS: In total, 175 mRS assessments were performed in 59 patients. New or 
worsening EAs developed in 23 (39%) patients, and new background deterioration 
developed in 24 (41%). Among cEEG biomarkers, new or worsening EAs were 
independently associated with mRS at discharge, 3, and 6 months, respectively 
(adjusted cumulative proportional odds 4.99, 95% CI 1.60-15.6; 3.28, 95% CI 
1.14-9.5; and 2.71, 95% CI 0.95-7.76), but cEEG background deterioration lacked 
an association. Among hospital complications, DCI was associated with discharge, 
3-, and 6-month outcomes (adjusted cumulative proportional odds 4.75, 95% CI 
1.64-13.8; 3.4; 95% CI 1.24-9.01; and 2.45, 95% CI 0.94-6.6), but HAI and 
hydrocephalus lacked an association. The mixed effects model demonstrated that 
these associations were sustained over longitudinal assessments without an 
interaction with time.
CONCLUSION: Although new or worsening EAs and cEEG background deterioration have 
both been shown to predict DCI, only new or worsening EAs are associated with a 
sustained impairment in functional outcome. This novel finding raises the 
potential for identifying therapeutic targets that may also influence outcomes.

Secondary brain injury (SBI) is defined as new or worsening injury to the brain 
after an initial neurologic insult, such as hemorrhage, trauma, ischemic stroke, 
or infection. It is a common and potentially preventable complication following 
many types of primary brain injury (PBI). However, mechanistic details about how 
PBI leads to additional brain injury and evolves into SBI are poorly 
characterized. In this work, we propose a mechanistic model for the metabolic 
supply demand mismatch hypothesis (MSDMH) of SBI. Our model, based on the 
Hodgkin-Huxley model, supplemented with additional dynamics for extracellular 
potassium, oxygen concentration, and excitotoxity, provides a high-level unified 
explanation for why patients with acute brain injury frequently develop SBI. We 
investigate how decreased oxygen, increased extracellular potassium, 
excitotoxicity, and seizures can induce SBI and suggest three underlying paths 
for how events following PBI may lead to SBI. The proposed model also helps 
explain several important empirical observations, including the common 
association of acute brain injury with seizures, the association of seizures 
with tissue hypoxia and so on. In contrast to current practices which assume 
that ischemia plays the predominant role in SBI, our model suggests that 
metabolic crisis involved in SBI can also be nonischemic. Our findings offer a 
more comprehensive understanding of the complex interrelationship among 
potassium, oxygen, excitotoxicity, seizures, and SBI.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We present 
a novel mechanistic model for the metabolic supply demand mismatch hypothesis 
(MSDMH), which attempts to explain why patients with acute brain injury 
frequently develop seizure activity and secondary brain injury (SBI). 
Specifically, we investigate how decreased oxygen, increased extracellular 
potassium, excitotoxicity, seizures, all common sequalae of primary brain injury 
(PBI), can induce SBI and suggest three underlying paths for how events 
following PBI may lead to SBI.

OBJECTIVE: Current cardiac surgery risk models do not address a substantial 
fraction of procedures. We sought to create models to predict the risk of 
operative mortality for an expanded set of cases.
: Four supervised machine learning models were trained using preoperative 
variables present in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) data set of the 
Massachusetts General Hospital to predict and classify operative mortality in 
procedures without STS risk scores. A total of 424 (5.5%) mortality events 
occurred out of 7745 cases. Models included logistic regression with elastic net 
regularization (LogReg), support vector machine, random forest (RF), and extreme 
gradient boosted trees (XGBoost). Model discrimination was assessed via area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and calibration was 
assessed via calibration slope and expected-to-observed event ratio. External 
validation was performed using STS data sets from Brigham and Women's Hospital 
(BWH) and the Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH).
RESULTS: Models performed comparably with the highest mean AUC of 0.83 (RF) and 
expected-to-observed event ratio of 1.00. On external validation, the AUC was 
0.81 in BWH (RF) and 0.79 in JHH (LogReg/RF). Models trained and applied on the 
same institution's data achieved AUCs of 0.81 (BWH: LogReg/RF/XGBoost) and 0.82 
(JHH: LogReg/RF/XGBoost).
CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning models trained on preoperative patient data can 
predict operative mortality at a high level of accuracy for cardiac surgical 
procedures without established risk scores. Such procedures comprise 23% of all 
cardiac surgical procedures nationwide. This work also highlights the value of 
using local institutional data to train new prediction models that account for 
institution-specific practices.

This report presents an overview of how machine learning is rapidly advancing 
clinical translational imaging in ways that will aid in the early detection, 
prediction, and treatment of diseases that threaten brain health. Towards this 
goal, we aresharing the information presented at a symposium, "Neuroimaging 
Indicators of Brain Structure and Function - Closing the Gap Between Research 
and Clinical Application", co-hosted by the McCance Center for Brain Health at 
Mass General Hospital and the MIT HST Neuroimaging Training Program on February 
12, 2021. The symposium focused on the potential for machine learning 
approaches, applied to increasingly large-scale neuroimaging datasets, to 
transform healthcare delivery and change the trajectory of brain health by 
addressing brain care earlier in the lifespan. While not exhaustive, this 
overview uniquely addresses many of the technical challenges from image 
formation, to analysis and visualization, to synthesis and incorporation into 
the clinical workflow. Some of the ethical challenges inherent to this work are 
also explored, as are some of the regulatory requirements for implementation. We 
seek to educate, motivate, and inspire graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, 
and early career investigators to contribute to a future where neuroimaging 
meaningfully contributes to the maintenance of brain health.

As continuous brain monitoring becomes a routine part of clinical care, 
continuous EEG has allowed better detection and characterization of 
nonconvulsive seizures, and patterns along the ictal-interictal continuum in 
critically ill patients. However, this increased workload has led many to turn 
to quantitative EEG whose central tool is the "spectrogram." Although in 
relatively wide use, many clinicians lack a detailed understanding of how 
spectrograms relate to the underlying "raw" EEG signal. This article provides an 
approachable set of first principles to help clinicians understand how 
spectrograms encode information about the raw EEG and how to interpret 
spectrograms to efficiently infer underlying EEG patterns.

BACKGROUND: Intraoperative burst-suppression is associated with postoperative 
delirium. Whether this association is causal remains unclear. Therefore, the 
s investigated whether burst-suppression during cardiopulmonary bypass 
(CPB) mediates the effects of known delirium risk factors on postoperative 
delirium.
: This was a retrospective cohort observational substudy of the 
Minimizing ICU [intensive care unit] Neurological Dysfunction with 
Dexmedetomidine-induced Sleep (MINDDS) trial. The s analyzed data from 
patients more than 60 yr old undergoing cardiac surgery (n = 159). Univariate 
and multivariable regression analyses were performed to assess for associations 
and enable causal inference. Delirium risk factors were evaluated using the 
abbreviated Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Patient-Reported Outcomes 
Measurement Information System questionnaires for applied cognition, physical 
function, global health, sleep, and pain. The s also analyzed 
electroencephalogram data (n = 141).
RESULTS: The incidence of delirium in patients with CPB burst-suppression was 
25% (15 of 60) compared with 6% (5 of 81) in patients without CPB 
burst-suppression. In univariate analyses, age (odds ratio, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.03 
to 1.14]; P = 0.002), lowest CPB temperature (odds ratio, 0.79 [0.66 to 0.94]; P 
= 0.010), alpha power (odds ratio, 0.65 [0.54 to 0.80]; P < 0.001), and physical 
function (odds ratio, 0.95 [0.91 to 0.98]; P = 0.007) were associated with CPB 
burst-suppression. In separate univariate analyses, age (odds ratio, 1.09 [1.02 
to 1.16]; P = 0.009), abbreviated Montreal Cognitive Assessment (odds ratio, 
0.80 [0.66 to 0.97]; P = 0.024), alpha power (odds ratio, 0.75 [0.59 to 0.96]; P 
= 0.025), and CPB burst-suppression (odds ratio, 3.79 [1.5 to 9.6]; P = 0.005) 
were associated with delirium. However, only physical function (odds ratio, 0.96 
[0.91 to 0.99]; P = 0.044), lowest CPB temperature (odds ratio, 0.73 [0.58 to 
0.88]; P = 0.003), and electroencephalogram alpha power (odds ratio, 0.61 [0.47 
to 0.76]; P < 0.001) were retained as predictors in the burst-suppression 
multivariable model. Burst-suppression (odds ratio, 4.1 [1.5 to 13.7]; P = 
0.012) and age (odds ratio, 1.07 [0.99 to 1.15]; P = 0.090) were retained as 
predictors in the delirium multivariable model. Delirium was associated with 
decreased electroencephalogram power from 6.8 to 24.4 Hertz.
CONCLUSIONS: The inference from the present study is that CPB burst-suppression 
mediates the effects of physical function, lowest CPB temperature, and 
electroencephalogram alpha power on delirium.

The human electroencephalogram (EEG) of sleep undergoes profound changes with 
age. These changes can be conceptualized as "brain age (BA)," which can be 
compared to chronological age to reflect the degree of deviation from normal 
aging. Here, we develop an interpretable machine learning model to predict BA 
based on 2 large sleep EEG data sets: the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) 
sleep lab data set (N = 2532; ages 18-80); and the Sleep Heart Health Study 
(SHHS, N = 1974; ages 40-80). The model obtains a mean absolute deviation of 
7.6 years between BA and chronological age (CA) in healthy participants in the 
MGH data set. As validation, a subset of SHHS containing longitudinal EEGs 
5.2 years apart shows an average of 5.4 years increase in BA. Participants with 
significant neurological or psychiatric disease exhibit a mean excess BA, or 
"brain age index" (BAI = BA-CA) of 4 years relative to healthy controls. 
Participants with hypertension and diabetes have a mean excess BA of 3.5 years. 
The findings raise the prospect of using the sleep EEG as a potential biomarker 
for healthy brain aging.

To develop a physiologic grading system for the severity of acute encephalopathy 
manifesting as delirium or coma, based on EEG, and to investigate its 
association with clinical outcomes.
DESIGN: This prospective, single-center, observational cohort study was 
conducted from August 2015 to December 2016 and October 2018 to December 2019.
SETTING: Academic medical center, all inpatient wards.
PATIENTS/SUBJECTS: Adult inpatients undergoing a clinical EEG recording; 
excluded if deaf, severely aphasic, developmentally delayed, non-English 
speaking (if noncomatose), or if goals of care focused primarily on comfort 
measures. Four-hundred six subjects were assessed; two were excluded due to 
technical EEG difficulties.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A machine learning model, with visually coded EEG 
features as inputs, was developed to produce scores that correlate with 
behavioral assessments of delirium severity (Confusion Assessment 
Method-Severity [CAM-S] Long Form [LF] scores) or coma; evaluated using Spearman 
R correlation; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC); and 
calibration curves. Associations of Visual EEG Confusion Assessment Method 
Severity (VE-CAM-S) were measured for three outcomes: functional status at 
discharge (via Glasgow Outcome Score [GOS]), inhospital mortality, and 3-month 
mortality. Four-hundred four subjects were analyzed (mean [sd] age, 59.8 yr 
[17.6 yr]; 232 [57%] male; 320 [79%] White; 339 [84%] non-Hispanic); 132 (33%) 
without delirium or coma, 143 (35%) with delirium, and 129 (32%) with coma. 
VE-CAM-S scores correlated strongly with CAM-S scores (Spearman correlation 0.67 
[0.62-0.73]; p < 0.001) and showed excellent discrimination between levels of 
delirium (CAM-S LF = 0 vs ≥ 4, AUC 0.85 [0.78-0.92], calibration slope of 1.04 
[0.87-1.19] for CAM-S LF ≤ 4 vs ≥ 5). VE-CAM-S scores were strongly associated 
with important clinical outcomes including inhospital mortality (AUC 0.79 
[0.72-0.84]), 3-month mortality (AUC 0.78 [0.71-0.83]), and GOS at discharge 
(0.76 [0.69-0.82]).
CONCLUSIONS: VE-CAM-S is a physiologic grading scale for the severity of 
symptoms in the setting of delirium and coma, based on visually assessed 
electroencephalography features. VE-CAM-S scores are strongly associated with 
clinical outcomes.

Computational Evidence for a Competitive Thalamocortical Model of Spikes and 
Spindle Activity in Rolandic Epilepsy.

Rolandic epilepsy (RE) is the most common idiopathic focal childhood epilepsy 
syndrome, characterized by sleep-activated epileptiform spikes and seizures and 
cognitive deficits in school age children. Recent evidence suggests that this 
disease may be caused by disruptions to the Rolandic thalamocortical circuit, 
resulting in both an abundance of epileptiform spikes and a paucity of sleep 
spindles in the Rolandic cortex during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM); 
electrographic features linked to seizures and cognitive symptoms, respectively. 
The neuronal mechanisms that support the competitive shared thalamocortical 
circuitry between pathological epileptiform spikes and physiological sleep 
spindles are not well-understood. In this study we introduce a computational 
thalamocortical model for the sleep-activated epileptiform spikes observed in 
RE. The cellular and neuronal circuits of this model incorporate recent 
experimental observations in RE, and replicate the electrophysiological features 
of RE. Using this model, we demonstrate that:  epileptiform spikes can be 
triggered and promoted by either a reduced NMDA current or h-type current; and 
(2) changes in inhibitory transmission in the thalamic reticular nucleus 
mediates an antagonistic dynamic between epileptiform spikes and spindles. This 
work provides the first computational model that both recapitulates 
electrophysiological features and provides a mechanistic explanation for the 
thalamocortical switch between the pathological and physiological 
electrophysiological rhythms observed during NREM sleep in this common epileptic 
encephalopathy.

OBJECTIVES: Scoring laboratory polysomnography (PSG) data remains a manual task 
of visually annotating 3 primary categories: sleep stages, sleep disordered 
breathing, and limb movements. Attempts to automate this process have been 
hampered by the complexity of PSG signals and physiological heterogeneity 
between patients. Deep neural networks, which have recently achieved 
expert-level performance for other complex medical tasks, are ideally suited to 
PSG scoring, given sufficient training data.
: We used a combination of deep recurrent and convolutional neural 
networks (RCNN) for supervised learning of clinical labels designating sleep 
stages, sleep apnea events, and limb movements. The data for testing and 
training were derived from 10 000 clinical PSGs and 5804 research PSGs.
RESULTS: When trained on the clinical dataset, the RCNN reproduces PSG 
diagnostic scoring for sleep staging, sleep apnea, and limb movements with 
accuracies of 87.6%, 88.2% and 84.7% on held-out test data, a level of 
performance comparable to human experts. The RCNN model performs equally well 
when tested on the independent research PSG database. Only small reductions in 
accuracy were noted when training on limited channels to mimic at-home 
monitoring devices: frontal leads only for sleep staging, and thoracic belt 
signals only for the apnea-hypopnea index.
CONCLUSIONS: By creating accurate deep learning models for sleep scoring, our 
work opens the path toward broader and more timely access to sleep diagnostics. 
Accurate scoring automation can improve the utility and efficiency of in-lab and 
at-home approaches to sleep diagnostics, potentially extending the reach of 
sleep expertise beyond specialty clinics.

OBJECTIVE: The optimal treatment of nonconvulsive seizures in critically ill 
patients is uncertain. We evaluated the comparative effectiveness of the 
antiseizure drugs lacosamide (LCM) and fosphenytoin (fPHT) in this population.
: The TRENdS (Treatment of Recurrent Electrographic Nonconvulsive 
Seizures) study was a noninferiority, prospective, multicenter, randomized 
treatment trial of patients diagnosed with nonconvulsive seizures (NCSs) by 
continuous electroencephalography (cEEG). Treatment was randomized to 
intravenous (IV) LCM 400mg or IV fPHT 20mg phenytoin equivalents/kg. The primary 
endpoint was absence of electrographic seizures for 24 hours as determined by 1 
blinded EEG reviewer. The frequency with which NCS control was achieved in each 
arm was compared, and the 90% confidence interval (CI) was determined. 
Noninferiority of LCM to fPHT was to be concluded if the lower bound of the CI 
for relative risk was >0.8.
RESULTS: Seventy-four subjects were enrolled (37 LCM, 37 fPHT) between August 
21, 2012 and December 20, 2013. The mean age was 63.6 years; 38 were women. 
Seizures were controlled in 19 of 30 (63.3%) subjects in the LCM arm and 16 of 
32 (50%) subjects in the fPHT arm. LCM was noninferior to fPHT (p = 0.02), with 
a risk ratio of 1.27 (90% CI = 0.88-1.83). Treatment emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) were similar in both arms, occurring in 9 of 35 (25.7%) LCM and 9 of 37 
(24.3%) fPHT subjects (p = 1.0).
INTERPRETATION: LCM was noninferior to fPHT in controlling NCS, and TEAEs were 
comparable. LCM can be considered an alternative to fPHT in the treatment of

OBJECTIVE: Functional seizures (FS) are often misclassified as epileptic 
seizures (ES). This study aimed to create an easy to use but comprehensive 
screening tool to guide further evaluation of patients presenting with this 
diagnostic dilemma.
MATERIALS AND : Demographic, clinical and diagnostic data were collected 
on patients admitted for video-EEG monitoring for clarification of their 
diagnosis. Upon discharge, patients were classified as having ES vs FS. Using 
the collected characteristics and video-EEG diagnosis, we created a 
multivariable logistic regression model to identify predictors of ES. Then, we 
trained an integer-coefficient model with the most frequently selected 
predictors, creating a pointing system coined DDESVSFS, with scores ranging from 
-17 to +8 points.
RESULTS: 43 patients with FS and 165 patients with ES were recruited. In the 
final integer-coefficient model, 8 predictors were identified as significant in 
differentiating ES from FS: normal electroencephalogram (-3 points), 
predisposing factors for FS (-3 points), increased number of comorbidities (-3 
points), semiology suggestive of FS (-4 points), increased seizure frequency (-4 
points), longer disease duration (+3 points), antiepileptic polypharmacy (+2 
points) and compliance with antiepileptic drugs (+3 points). Cumulative scores 
of ≤ -9 points carried <5% predictive value for ES, while cumulative scores of ≥ 
-1 points carried >95% predictive value. The model performed well (AUC: 0.923, 
sensitivity: 0.945, specificity: 0.698).
CONCLUSIONS: We propose DDESVSFS as a simple, rapid and comprehensive prediction 
score for the Differential Diagnosis of Epileptic Seizures VS Functional 
Seizures. Large prospective studies are needed to evaluate its utility in 
clinical practice.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Reports have suggested that severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes neurologic manifestations including 
encephalopathy and seizures. However, there has been relatively limited 
electrophysiology data to contextualize these specific concerns and to 
understand their associated clinical factors. Our objective was to identify EEG 
abnormalities present in patients with SARS-CoV-2, and to determine whether they 
reflect new or preexisting brain pathology.
: We studied a consecutive series of hospitalized patients with 
SARS-CoV-2 who received an EEG, obtained using tailored safety protocols. Data 
from EEG reports and clinical records were analyzed to identify EEG 
abnormalities and possible clinical associations, including neurologic symptoms, 
new or preexisting brain pathology, and sedation practices.
RESULTS: We identified 37 patients with SARS-CoV-2 who underwent EEG, of whom 14 
had epileptiform findings (38%). Patients with epileptiform findings were more 
likely to have preexisting brain pathology (6/14, 43%) than patients without 
epileptiform findings (2/23, 9%; p = 0.042). There were no clear differences in 
rates of acute brain pathology. One case of nonconvulsive status epilepticus was 
captured, but was not clearly a direct consequence of SARS-CoV-2. Abnormalities 
of background rhythms were common, as may be seen in systemic illness, and in 
part associated with recent sedation (p = 0.022).
CONCLUSIONS: Epileptiform abnormalities were common in patients with SARS-CoV-2 
referred for EEG, but particularly in the context of preexisting brain pathology 
and sedation. These findings suggest that neurologic manifestations during 
SARS-CoV-2 infection may not solely relate to the infection itself, but rather 
may also reflect patients' broader, preexisting neurologic vulnerabilities.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a treatable contributor to 
morbidity and mortality. However, most patients with OSA remain undiagnosed. We 
used a new machine learning method known as SLIM (Supersparse Linear Integer 
Models) to test the hypothesis that a diagnostic screening tool based on 
routinely available medical information would be superior to one based solely on 
patient-reported sleep-related symptoms.
: We analyzed polysomnography (PSG) and self-reported clinical 
information from 1,922 patients tested in our clinical sleep laboratory. We used 
SLIM and 7 state-of-the-art classification  to produce predictive models 
for OSA screening using features from: (i) self-reported symptoms; (ii) 
self-reported medical information that could, in principle, be extracted from 
electronic health records (demographics, comorbidities), or (iii) both.
RESULTS: For diagnosing OSA, we found that model performance using only medical 
history features was superior to model performance using symptoms alone, and 
similar to model performance using all features. Performance was similar to that 
reported for other widely used tools: sensitivity 64.2% and specificity 77%. 
SLIM accuracy was similar to state-of-the-art classification models applied to 
this dataset, but with the benefit of full transparency, allowing for hands-on 
prediction using yes/no answers to a small number of clinical queries.
CONCLUSION: To predict OSA, variables such as age, sex, BMI, and medical history 
are superior to the symptom variables we examined for predicting OSA. SLIM 
produces an actionable clinical tool that can be applied to data that is 
routinely available in modern electronic health records, which may facilitate 
automated, rather than manual, OSA screening.

OBJECTIVE: Find the optimal continuous electroencephalographic (CEEG) monitoring 
duration for seizure detection in critically ill patients.
: We analyzed prospective data from 665 consecutive CEEGs, including 
clinical factors and time-to-event emergence of electroencephalographic (EEG) 
findings over 72 hours. Clinical factors were selected using logistic 
regression. EEG risk factors were selected a priori. Clinical factors were used 
for baseline (pre-EEG) risk. EEG findings were used for the creation of a 
multistate survival model with 3 states (entry, EEG risk, and seizure). EEG risk 
state is defined by emergence of epileptiform patterns.
RESULTS: The clinical variables of greatest predictive value were coma (31% had 
seizures; odds ratio [OR] = 1.8, p < 0.01) and history of seizures, either 
remotely or related to acute illness (34% had seizures; OR = 3.0, p < 0.001). If 
there were no epileptiform findings on EEG, the risk of seizures within 72 hours 
was between 9% (no clinical risk factors) and 36% (coma and history of 
seizures). If epileptiform findings developed, the seizure incidence was between 
18% (no clinical risk factors) and 64% (coma and history of seizures). In the 
absence of epileptiform EEG abnormalities, the duration of monitoring needed for 
seizure risk of <5% was between 0.4 hours (for patients who are not comatose and 
had no prior seizure) and 16.4 hours (comatose and prior seizure).
INTERPRETATION: The initial risk of seizures on CEEG is dependent on history of 
prior seizures and presence of coma. The risk of developing seizures on CEEG 
decays to <5% by 24 hours if no epileptiform EEG abnormalities emerge, 
independent of initial clinical risk factors. Ann Neurol 2017;82:177-185.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the amount of EEG suppression achieved in refractory 
status epilepticus (RSE) patients treated with pharmacologically-induced coma 
(PIC).
: We analyzed EEG recordings from 35 RSE patients between 21-84 years-old 
who received PIC that target burst suppression and quantified the amount of EEG 
suppression using the burst suppression probability (BSP). Then we measured the 
variability of BSPs with respect to a reference level of BSP 0.8 ± 0.15. 
Finally, we also measured the variability of BSPs with respect to the amount of 
intravenous anesthetic drugs (IVADs) received by the patients.
RESULTS: Patients remained in the reference BSP range for only 8% (median, 
interquartile range IQR [0, 29] %) of the total time under treatment. The median 
time with BSP below the reference range was 84% (IQR [37, 100] %). BSPs in some 
patients drifted significantly over time despite constant infusion rates of 
IVADs. Similar weight-normalized infusion rates of IVADs in different patients 
nearly always resulted in distinct BSPs (probability 0.93 (IQR [0.82, 1.0]).
CONCLUSION: This study quantitatively identified high variability in the amount 
of EEG suppression achieved in clinical practice when treating RSE patients. 
While some of this variability may arise from clinicians purposefully deviating 
from clinical practice guidelines, our results show that the high variability 
also arises in part from significant inter- and intra- individual 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic variation. Our results indicate that the 
delicate balance between maintaining sufficient EEG suppression in RSE patients 
and minimizing IVAD exposure in clinical practice is challenging to achieve. 
This may affect patient outcomes and confound studies seeking to determine an 
optimal amount of EEG suppression for treatment of RSE. Therefore, our analysis 
points to the need for developing an alternative paradigm, such as vigilant 
anesthetic management as happens in operating rooms, or closed-loop anesthesia 
delivery, for investigating and providing induced-coma therapy to RSE patients.

OBJECTIVES: Sepsis is a major public health concern with significant morbidity, 
mortality, and healthcare expenses. Early detection and antibiotic treatment of 
sepsis improve outcomes. However, although professional critical care societies 
have proposed new clinical criteria that aid sepsis recognition, the fundamental 
need for early detection and treatment remains unmet. In response, researchers 
have proposed algorithms for early sepsis detection, but directly comparing such 
 has not been possible because of different patient cohorts, clinical 
variables and sepsis criteria, prediction tasks, evaluation metrics, and other 
differences. To address these issues, the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology 
Challenge 2019 facilitated the development of automated, open-source algorithms 
for the early detection of sepsis from clinical data.
DESIGN: Participants submitted containerized algorithms to a cloud-based testing 
environment, where we graded entries for their binary classification performance 
using a novel clinical utility-based evaluation metric. We designed this scoring 
function specifically for the Challenge to reward algorithms for early 
predictions and penalize them for late or missed predictions and for false 
alarms.
SETTING: ICUs in three separate hospital systems. We shared data from two 
systems publicly and sequestered data from all three systems for scoring.
PATIENTS: We sourced over 60,000 ICU patients with up to 40 clinical variables 
for each hour of a patient's ICU stay. We applied Sepsis-3 clinical criteria for 
sepsis onset.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 104 groups from academia and industry 
participated, contributing 853 submissions. Furthermore, 90 abstracts based on 
Challenge entries were accepted for presentation at Computing in Cardiology.
CONCLUSIONS: Diverse computational approaches predict the onset of sepsis 
several hours before clinical recognition, but generalizability to different 
hospital systems remains a challenge.

Sleep medicine is well positioned to benefit from advances that use big data to 
create artificially intelligent computer programs. One obvious initial 
application in the sleep disorders center is the assisted (or enhanced) scoring 
of sleep and associated events during polysomnography (PSG). This position 
statement outlines the potential opportunities and limitations of integrating 
artificial intelligence (AI) into the practice of sleep medicine. Additionally, 
although the most apparent and immediate application of AI in our field is the 
assisted scoring of PSG, we propose potential clinical use cases that transcend 
the sleep laboratory and are expected to deepen our understanding of sleep 
disorders, improve patient-centered sleep care, augment day-to-day clinical 
operations, and increase our knowledge of the role of sleep in health at a 
population level.

PURPOSE: Triphasic waves arising in patients with toxic metabolic encephalopathy 
(TME) are often considered different from generalized periodic discharges (GPDs) 
in patients with generalized nonconvulsive status epilepticus (GNCSE). The 
primary objective of this study was to investigate whether a common mechanism 
can explain key aspects of both triphasic waves in TME and GPDs in GNCSE.
METHOD: A neural mass model was used for the simulation of EEG patterns in 
patients with acute hepatic encephalopathy, a common etiology of TME. Increased 
neuronal excitability and impaired synaptic transmission because of elevated 
ammonia levels in acute hepatic encephalopathy patients were used to explain how 
triphasic waves and GNCSE arise. The effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic 
drugs on epileptiform activity, simulated with a prolonged duration of the 
inhibitory postsynaptic potential, was also studied.
RESULTS: The simulations show that a model that includes increased neuronal 
excitability and impaired synaptic transmission can account for both the 
emergence of GPDs and GNCSE and their suppression by gamma-aminobutyric 
acid-ergic drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study add to evidence from other studies 
calling into question the dichotomy between triphasic waves in TME and GPDs in 
GNCSE and support the hypothesis that all GPDs, including those arising in TME 
patients, occur via a common mechanism.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between characteristics of lateralized 
periodic discharges (LPDs) and glucose metabolism measured by 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET.
: We retrospectively reviewed medical records to identify patients who 
underwent FDG-PET during EEG monitoring with LPDs present during the FDG uptake 
period. Two blinded board-certified neurophysiologists independently interpreted 
EEGs. FDG uptake was measured using standardized uptake value (SUV). Structural 
images were fused with PET images to aid with localization of SUV. Two PET 
readers independently measured maximum SUV. Relative SUV values were obtained by 
normalization of the maximum SUV to the SUV of pons (SUVRpons). LPD frequency 
was analyzed both as a categorical variable and as a continuous measure. Other 
secondary variables included duration, amplitude, presence of structural lesion, 
and "plus" EEG features such as rhythmic or fast sharp activity.
RESULTS: Nine patients were identified and 7 had a structural etiology for LPDs. 
Analysis using frequency as a categorical variable and continuous variable 
showed an association between increased LPD frequency and increased ipsilateral 
SUVRpons (p = 0.02). Metabolism associated with LPDs (0.5 Hz as a baseline) 
increased by a median of 100% at 1 Hz and for frequencies >1 Hz increased by a 
median of 309%. There were no statistically significant differences in SUVRpons 
for other factors including duration (p = 0.10), amplitude (p = 0.80), 
structural etiology (p = 0.55), or "plus" features such as rhythmic or fast 
sharp activity (p = 0.84).
CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic activity increases monotonically with LPD frequency. LPD 
frequency should be a measure of  when developing neuroprotection 
strategies in critical neurologic illness.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to estimate the time to recovery of 
command-following and associations between hypoxemia with time to recovery of 
command-following.
: In this multicenter, retrospective, cohort study during the initial 
surge of the United States' pandemic (March-July 2020) we estimate the time from 
intubation to recovery of command-following, using Kaplan Meier 
cumulative-incidence curves and Cox proportional hazard models. Patients were 
included if they were admitted to 1 of 3 hospitals because of severe coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19), required endotracheal intubation for at least 7 days, 
and experienced impairment of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale motor score <6).
RESULTS: Five hundred seventy-one patients of the 795 patients recovered 
command-following. The median time to recovery of command-following was 30 days 
(95% confidence interval [CI] = 27-32 days). Median time to recovery of 
command-following increased by 16 days for patients with at least one episode of 
an arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2 ) value ≤55 mmHg (p < 0.001), and 
25% recovered ≥10 days after cessation of mechanical ventilation. The time to 
recovery of command-following  was associated with hypoxemia (PaO2  ≤55 mmHg 
hazard ratio [HR] = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.46-0.68; PaO2  ≤70 HR = 0.88, 95% 
CI = 0.85-0.91), and each additional day of hypoxemia decreased the likelihood 
of recovery, accounting for confounders including sedation. These findings were 
confirmed among patients without any imagining evidence of structural brain 
injury (n = 199), and in a non-overlapping second surge cohort (N = 427, October 
2020 to April 2021).
INTERPRETATION: Survivors of severe COVID-19 commonly recover consciousness 
weeks after cessation of mechanical ventilation. Long recovery periods are 
associated with more severe hypoxemia. This relationship is not explained by 
sedation or brain injury identified on clinical imaging and should inform 
decisions about life-sustaining therapies. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:740-755.

PURPOSE: The Critical Care EEG Monitoring Research Consortium (CCEMRC) is an 
international research group focusing on critical care EEG and epilepsy. As 
CCEMRC grew to include 50+ institutions over the past decade, members met to 
establish research priorities.
: The s used an analytical hierarchy process-based research 
prioritization method, adapted from an approach previously applied to a 
Department of Defense health-related research program. Forty-six CCEMRC members 
identified and scored a set of eight clinical problems (CPs) and 15 research 
topic areas (RTAs) at an annual CCEMRC meeting. Members scored CPs on three 
criteria using a five-point ordinal scale: Incidence, Impact, and Gap Size; and 
RTAs on four additional criteria: Niche, Feasibility, Scientific Importance, and 
Medical Importance, each of which was assigned a weight. The first three RTA 
criteria were scored using a five-point scale, and CPs were mapped to RTAs using 
a four-point scale. The Medical Importance score was a weighted average of its 
mapping scores and the CP score. Finally, a Priority score was calculated for 
each RTA as a product of the four RTA criteria scores.
RESULTS: The CPs with the highest scores were "Altered mental status" and 
"Long-term neurologic disability after hospital discharge." The RTAs with the 
highest priority scores were "Development of risk prediction tools," 
"Multicenter observational studies," and "Outcome prediction."
CONCLUSIONS: Research prioritization helped CCEMRC evaluate its current research 
trajectory, identify high-priority near-term research pursuits, and create a 
roadmap for future research plans aligned with its mission. This approach may be 
helpful to other academic consortia and research programs.

Background and Purpose- We evaluated the association between 2 types of 
predictors of delayed cerebral ischemia after nontraumatic subarachnoid 
hemorrhage, including biomarkers of the innate immune response and 
neurophysiologic changes on continuous electroencephalography. - We 
studied subarachnoid hemorrhage patients that had at least 72 hours of 
continuous electroencephalography and blood samples collected within the first 5 
days of symptom onset. We measured inflammatory biomarkers previously associated 
with delayed cerebral ischemia and functional outcome, including soluble ST2 
(sST2), IL-6 (interleukin-6), and CRP (C-reactive protein). Serial plasma 
samples and cerebrospinal fluid sST2 levels were available in a subgroup of 
patients. Neurophysiologic changes were categorized into new or worsening 
epileptiform abnormalities (EAs) or new background deterioration. The 
association of biomarkers with neurophysiologic changes were evaluated using the 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid sST2 were further 
examined longitudinally using repeated measures mixed-effects models. Results- 
Forty-six patients met inclusion criteria. Seventeen (37%) patients developed 
new or worsening EAs, 21 (46%) developed new background deterioration, and 8 
(17%) developed neither. Early (day, 0-5) plasma sST2 levels were higher among 
patients with new or worsening EAs (median 115 ng/mL [interquartile range, 
73.8-197]) versus those without (74.7 ng/mL [interquartile range, 44.8-102]; 
P=0.024). Plasma sST2 levels were similar between patients with or without new 
background deterioration. Repeated measures mixed-effects modeling that adjusted 
for admission risk factors showed that the association with new or worsening EAs 
remained independent for both plasma sST2 (β=0.41 [95% CI, 0.09-0.73]; P=0.01) 
and cerebrospinal fluid sST2 (β=0.97 [95% CI, 0.14-1.8]; P=0.021). IL-6 and CRP 
were not associated with new background deterioration or with new or worsening 
EAs. Conclusions- In patients admitted with subarachnoid hemorrhage, sST2 level 
was associated with new or worsening EAs but not new background deterioration. 
This association may identify a link between a specific innate immune response 
pathway and continuous electroencephalography abnormalities in the pathogenesis 
of secondary brain injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Using observational data and variation in hospital admissions across days of the 
week, we examined the association between ED boarding time and development of 
delirium within 72 hours of admission among patients aged 65+ years admitted to 
an inpatient neurology ward. We exploited a natural experiment created by 
potentially exogenous variation in boarding time across days of the week because 
of competition for the neurology floor beds. Using proportional hazard models 
adjusting for socio-demographic and clinical characteristics in a propensity 
score, we examined the time to delirium onset among 858 patients: 2/3 were 
admitted for stroke, with the remaining admitted for another acute neurologic 
event. Among all patients, 81.2% had at least one delirium risk factor in 
addition to age. All eligible patients received delirium prevention protocols 
upon admission to the floor and received at least one delirium screening event. 
While the clinical and social-demographic characteristics of admitted patients 
were comparable across days of the week, patients with ED arrival on Sunday or 
Tuesday were more likely to have had delayed floor admission (waiting time 
greater than 13 hours) and delirium (adjusted HR = 1.54, 95%CI:1.37-1.75). 
Delayed initiation of delirium prevention protocol appeared to be associated 
with greater risk of delirium within the initial 72 hours of a hospital 
admission.

Comatose Patients.

BACKGROUND: Continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring may help to identify the small 
percentage of adults with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) who will regain 
consciousness if allowed sufficient time. However, the limited yield in this 
population has led some to question the cost-effectiveness cEEG monitoring in 
this population. We hypothesized that limited-montage cEEG could provide 
essentially the same neurophysiologic information at lower cost. In this proof 
of concept study, we aim to demonstrate the potentials of limited channel EEG in 
prognostication in postanoxic patients.
: We retrospectively reviewed cEEG data from cases monitored at our 
institution with conventional 21-channel EEG over a 6-month period. Twenty-eight 
cases were identified in which patients with HIE underwent cEEG for at least 24 
hours. Gold-standard findings were determined by conventional visual analysis of 
the full cEEG, and 2 independent electroencephalographers scored the same data 
using only limited-montage (4-channel) views. The sensitivity and specificity of 
limited-montage cEEG review were compared with conventional analysis. We also 
compared the relative costs of conventional and limited-montage EEG.
RESULTS: Using 4-channel limited montage cEEG, reviewers were able to classify 
accurately background continuity (in 88%), background amplitude (in 81%), 
maximum background frequency (in 70%), periodic epileptiform discharges, 
including a seizure (in 92%) and sporadic discharges (in 91%). All epileptiform 
features were detected with greater than 90% sensitivity and specificity. Eye 
movement artifact seen over bifrontal electrodes gave false positive detections 
of periodic epileptiform discharges in 31% of cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Limited-channel continuous EEG monitoring can provide meaningful 
electrophysiological data that can be used for prognostication in postanoxic 
comatose patients. Limited channel EEG can be a cost-effective alternative to 
conventional EEG monitoring in post-anoxic comatose patients.

D.G., M.B.W.) and Clinical Data Animation Center (M.B.W.), Massachusetts General 
Hospital, Boston.

OBJECTIVE: To determine which findings on routine clinical EEGs correlate with 
delirium severity across various presentations and to determine whether EEG 
findings independently predict important clinical outcomes.
: We prospectively studied a cohort of nonintubated inpatients undergoing 
EEG for evaluation of altered mental status. Patients were assessed for delirium 
within 1 hour of EEG with the 3-Minute Diagnostic Interview for Confusion 
Assessment Method (3D-CAM) and 3D-CAM severity score. EEGs were interpreted 
clinically by neurophysiologists, and reports were reviewed to identify features 
such as theta or delta slowing and triphasic waves. Generalized linear models 
were used to quantify associations among EEG findings, delirium, and clinical 
outcomes, including length of stay, Glasgow Outcome Scale scores, and mortality.
RESULTS: We evaluated 200 patients (median age 60 years, IQR 48.5-72 years); 121 
(60.5%) met delirium criteria. The EEG finding most strongly associated with 
delirium presence was a composite of generalized theta or delta slowing (odds 
ratio 10.3, 95% confidence interval 5.3-20.1). The prevalence of slowing 
correlated not only with overall delirium severity (R 2 = 0.907) but also with 
the severity of each feature assessed by CAM-based delirium algorithms. Slowing 
was common in delirium even with normal arousal. EEG slowing was associated with 
longer hospitalizations, worse functional outcomes, and increased mortality, 
even after adjustment for delirium presence or severity.
CONCLUSIONS: Generalized slowing on routine clinical EEG strongly correlates 
with delirium and may be a valuable biomarker for delirium severity. In 
addition, generalized EEG slowing should trigger elevated concern for the 
prognosis of patients with altered mental status.

OBJECTIVE: Quantitatively evaluate whether screening with compressed spectral 
arrays (CSAs) is a practical and time-effective protocol for assisting expert 
review of continuous EEG (cEEG) studies in hospitalized adults.
: Three neurophysiologists reviewed the reported findings of the first 30 
minutes of 118 cEEGs, then used CSA to guide subsequent review ("CSA-guided 
review" protocol). Reviewers viewed 120 seconds of raw EEG data surrounding 
suspicious CSA segments. The same neurophysiologists performed independent 
page-by-page visual interpretation ("conventional review") of all cEEGs. 
Independent conventional review by 2 additional, more experienced 
neurophysiologists served as a gold standard. We compared review times and 
detection rates for seizures and other pathologic patterns relative to 
conventional review.
RESULTS: A total of 2,092 hours of cEEG data were reviewed. Average times to 
review 24 hours of cEEG data were 8 (±4) minutes for CSA-guided review vs 38 
(±17) minutes for conventional review (p < 0.005). Studies containing seizures 
required longer review: 10 (±4) minutes for CSA-guided review vs 44 (±20) 
minutes for conventional review (p < 0.005). CSA-guided review was sensitive for 
seizures (87.3%), periodic epileptiform discharges (100%), rhythmic delta 
activity (97.1%), focal slowing (98.7%), generalized slowing (100%), and 
epileptiform discharges (88.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: CSA-guided review reduces cEEG review time by 78% with minimal loss 
of sensitivity compared with conventional review.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence that screening 
of cEEG with CSAs efficiently and accurately identifies seizures and other EEG 
abnormalities as compared with standard cEEG visual interpretation.

Decision Modeling in Sleep Apnea: The Critical Roles of Pretest Probability, 
Cost of Untreated Obstructive Sleep Apnea, and Time Horizon.

Neurology Department, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with increased 
morbidity and mortality, and treatment with positive airway pressure (PAP) is 
cost-effective. However, the optimal diagnostic strategy remains a subject of 
debate. Prior modeling studies have not consistently supported the widely held 
assumption that home sleep testing (HST) is cost-effective.
: We modeled four strategies:  treat no one; (2) treat everyone 
empirically; (3) treat those testing positive during in-laboratory 
polysomnography (PSG) via in-laboratory titration; and (4) treat those testing 
positive during HST with auto-PAP. The population was assumed to lack 
independent reasons for in-laboratory PSG (such as insomnia, periodic limb 
movements in sleep, complex apnea). We considered the third-party payer 
perspective, via both standard (quality-adjusted) and pure cost .
RESULTS: The preferred strategy depended on three key factors: pretest 
probability of OSA, cost of untreated OSA, and time horizon. At low prevalence 
and low cost of untreated OSA, the treat no one strategy was favored, whereas 
empiric treatment was favored for high prevalence and high cost of untreated 
OSA. In-laboratory backup for failures in the at-home strategy increased the 
preference for the at-home strategy. Without laboratory backup in the at-home 
arm, the in-laboratory strategy was increasingly preferred at longer time 
horizons.
CONCLUSION: Using a model framework that captures a broad range of clinical 
possibilities, the optimal diagnostic approach to uncomplicated OSA depends on 
pretest probability, cost of untreated OSA, and time horizon. Estimating each of 
these critical factors remains a challenge warranting further investigation.

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to analyze and compare the use of therapeutic coma (TC) 
for refractory status epilepticus (SE) across different centers and its effect 
on outcome.
: Clinical data for all consecutive adults (>16 years) with SE of all 
etiologies (except postanoxic) admitted to 4 tertiary care centers belonging to 
Harvard Affiliated Hospitals (HAH) and the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire 
Vaudois (CHUV) were prospectively collected and analyzed for TC details, 
mortality, and duration of hospitalization.
RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-six SE episodes in the CHUV and 126 in the HAH were 
identified. Both groups were homogeneous in demographics, comorbidities, SE 
characteristics, and Status Epilepticus Severity Score (STESS); TC was used in 
25.4% of cases in HAH vs 9.75% in CHUV. After adjustment, TC use was associated 
with younger age, lower Charlson Comorbidity Index, increasing SE severity, 
refractory SE, and center (odds ratio 11.3 for HAH vs CHUV, 95% confidence 
interval 2.47-51.7). Mortality was associated with increasing Charlson 
Comorbidity Index and STESS, etiology, and refractory SE. Length of stay 
correlated with STESS, etiology, refractory SE, and use of TC (incidence rate 
ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.22-2.11).
CONCLUSIONS: Use of TC for SE treatment seems markedly different between centers 
from the United States and Europe, and did not affect mortality considering the 
whole cohort. However, TC may increase length of hospital stay and related 
costs.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that for 
patients with SE, TC does not significantly affect mortality. The study lacked 
the precision to exclude an important effect of TC on mortality.

We hypothesize that epileptiform abnormalities (EAs) in the electroencephalogram 
(EEG) during the acute period following traumatic brain injury (TBI) 
independently predict first-year post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE1 ). We analyze 
PTE1 risk factors in two cohorts matched for TBI severity and age (n = 50). EAs 
independently predict risk for PTE1 (odds ratio [OR], 3.16 [0.99, 11.68]); 
subdural hematoma is another independent risk factor (OR, 4.13 [1.18, 39.33]). 
Differences in EA rates are apparent within 5 days following TBI. Our results 
suggest that increased EA prevalence identifies patients at increased risk for 
PTE1 , and that EAs acutely post-TBI can identify patients most likely to 
benefit from antiepileptogenesis drug trials. Ann Neurol 2018;83:858-862.

OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of seizures and other types of epileptiform brain 
activity in patients undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is 
unknown. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of seizures and ictal-interictal 
continuum patterns in patients undergoing electroencephalography (EEG) during 
ECMO.
: Retrospective review of a prospective ECMO registry from 2011-2018 in a 
university-affiliated academic hospital. Adult subjects who had decreased level 
of consciousness and underwent EEG monitoring for seizure screening were 
included. EEG classification followed the American Clinical Neurophysiology 
Society criteria. Poor neurological outcome was defined as a Cerebral 
Performance Category of 3-5 at hospital discharge.
RESULTS: Three hundred and ninety-five subjects had ECMO, and one hundred and 
thirteen (28.6%) had EEG monitoring. Ninety-two (23.3%) subjects had EEG 
performed during ECMO and were included in the study (average EEG duration 
54 h). Veno-arterial ECMO was the most common cannulation strategy (83%) and 26 
(28%) subjects had extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Fifty-eight 
subjects (63%) had epileptiform activity or ictal-interictal continuum patterns 
on EEG, including three (3%) subjects with nonconvulsive status epilepticus, 33 
(36%) generalized periodic discharges, and 4 (5%) lateralized periodic 
discharges. Comparison between subjects with or without epileptiform activity 
showed comparable in-hospital mortality (57% vs. 47%, p = 0.38) and poor 
neurological outcome (and 56% and 36%, p = 0.23). Twenty-seven subjects (33%) 
had acute neuroimaging abnormalities (stroke N = 21).
CONCLUSIONS: Seizures and ictal-interictal continuum patterns are commonly 
observed in patients managed with ECMO. Further studies are needed to evaluate 
whether epileptiform activity is an actionable target for interventions.
SIGNIFICANCE: Epileptiform and ictal-interictal continuum abnormalities are 
frequently observed in patients supported with ECMO undergoing EEG monitoring.

Effects of Cholinergic Neuromodulation on Thalamocortical Rhythms During NREM 
Sleep: A Model Study.

It has been suggested that cholinergic neurons shape the oscillatory activity of 
the thalamocortical (TC) network in behavioral and electrophysiological 
experiments. However, theoretical modeling demonstrating how cholinergic 
neuromodulation of thalamocortical rhythms during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) 
sleep might occur has been lacking. In this paper, we first develop a novel 
computational model (TC-ACH) by incorporating a cholinergic neuron population 
(CH) into the classical thalamo-cortical circuitry, where connections between 
populations are modeled in accordance with existing knowledge. The 
neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACH) released by neurons in CH, which is able to 
change the discharge activity of thalamocortical neurons, is the primary focus 
of our work. Simulation results with our TC-ACH model reveal that the 
cholinergic projection activity is a key factor in modulating oscillation 
patterns in three ways:  transitions between different patterns of 
thalamocortical oscillations are dramatically modulated through diverse 
projection pathways; (2) the model expresses a stable spindle oscillation state 
with certain parameter settings for the cholinergic projection from CH to 
thalamus, and more spindles appear when the strength of cholinergic input from 
CH to thalamocortical neurons increases; (3) the duration of oscillation 
patterns during NREM sleep including K-complexes, spindles, and slow 
oscillations is longer when cholinergic input from CH to thalamocortical neurons 
becomes stronger. Our modeling results provide insights into the mechanisms by 
which the sleep state is controlled, and provide a theoretical basis for future 
experimental and clinical studies.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between scalp EEG biomarkers of 
hyperexcitability in Alzheimer disease (AD) and to determine how these electric 
biomarkers relate to the clinical expression of seizures in AD.
: In this cross-sectional study, we performed 24-hour ambulatory scalp 
EEGs on 43 cognitively normal elderly healthy controls (HC), 41 participants 
with early-stage AD with no history or risk factors for epilepsy (AD-NoEp), and 
15 participants with early-stage AD with late-onset epilepsy related to AD 
(AD-Ep). Two epileptologists blinded to diagnosis visually reviewed all EEGs and 
annotated all potential epileptiform abnormalities. A panel of 9 epileptologists 
blinded to diagnosis was then surveyed to generate a consensus interpretation of 
epileptiform abnormalities in each EEG.
RESULTS: Epileptiform abnormalities were seen in 53% of AD-Ep, 22% of AD-NoEp, 
and 4.7% of HC. Specific features of epileptiform discharges, including high 
frequency, robust morphology, right temporal location, and occurrence during 
wakefulness and REM, were associated with clinical seizures in AD. Multiple EEG 
biomarkers concordantly demonstrated a pattern of left temporal lobe 
hyperexcitability in early stages of AD, whereas clinical seizures in AD were 
often associated with bitemporal hyperexcitability. Frequent small sharp spikes 
were specifically associated with epileptiform EEGs and thus identified as a 
potential biomarker of hyperexcitability in AD.
CONCLUSION: Epileptiform abnormalities are common in AD but not all equivalent. 
Specific features of epileptiform discharges are associated with clinical 
seizures in AD. Given the difficulty recognizing clinical seizures in AD, these 
EEG features could provide guidance on which patients with AD are at high risk 
for clinical seizures.

Automatic Classification of Sedation Levels in ICU Patients Using Heart Rate 
Variability.

School, Boston, MA.2Department of Anaesthesia, Massachusetts General Hospital,

OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential value of heart rate variability features for 
automated monitoring of sedation levels in mechanically ventilated ICU patients.
DESIGN: Multicenter, pilot study.
SETTING: Several ICUs at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.
PATIENTS: Electrocardiogram recordings from 40 mechanically ventilated adult 
patients receiving sedatives in an ICU setting were used to develop and test the 
proposed automated system.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale scores were 
acquired prospectively to assess patient sedation levels and were used as ground 
truth. Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale scores were grouped into four levels, 
denoted "unarousable" (Richmond Agitation- Sedation Scale = -5, -4), "sedated" 
(-3, -2, -1), "awake" (0), "agitated" (+1, +2, +3, +4). A multiclass support 
vector machine algorithm was used for classification. Classifier training and 
performance evaluations were carried out using leave-oneout cross validation. An 
overall accuracy of 69% was achieved for discriminating between the four levels 
of sedation. The proposed system was able to reliably discriminate (accuracy = 
79%) between sedated (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale < 0) and nonsedated 
states (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale > 0).
CONCLUSIONS: With further refinement, the methodology reported herein could lead 
to a fully automated system for depth of sedation monitoring. By enabling 
monitoring to be continuous, such technology may help clinical staff to monitor 
sedation levels more effectively and to reduce complications related to over- 
and undersedation.

BACKGROUND: Electroencephalogram patterns observed during sedation with 
dexmedetomidine appear similar to those observed during general anesthesia with 
propofol. This is evident with the occurrence of slow (0.1 to 1 Hz), delta (1 to 
4 Hz), propofol-induced alpha (8 to 12 Hz), and dexmedetomidine-induced spindle 
(12 to 16 Hz) oscillations. However, these drugs have different molecular 
mechanisms and behavioral properties and are likely accompanied by 
distinguishing neural circuit dynamics.
: The s measured 64-channel electroencephalogram under 
dexmedetomidine (n = 9) and propofol (n = 8) in healthy volunteers, 18 to 36 yr 
of age. The s administered dexmedetomidine with a 1-µg/kg loading bolus 
over 10 min, followed by a 0.7 µg kg h infusion. For propofol, the s used 
a computer-controlled infusion to target the effect-site concentration gradually 
from 0 to 5 μg/ml. Volunteers listened to auditory stimuli and responded by 
button press to determine unconsciousness. The s analyzed the 
electroencephalogram using multitaper spectral and coherence analysis.
RESULTS: Dexmedetomidine was characterized by spindles with maximum power and 
coherence at approximately 13 Hz (mean ± SD; power, -10.8 ± 3.6 dB; coherence, 
0.8 ± 0.08), whereas propofol was characterized with frontal alpha oscillations 
with peak frequency at approximately 11 Hz (power, 1.1 ± 4.5 dB; coherence, 0.9 
± 0.05). Notably, slow oscillation power during a general anesthetic state under 
propofol (power, 13.2 ± 2.4 dB) was much larger than during sedative states 
under both propofol (power, -2.5 ± 3.5 dB) and dexmedetomidine (power, -0.4 ± 
3.1 dB).
CONCLUSION: The results indicate that dexmedetomidine and propofol place 
patients into different brain states and suggest that propofol enables a deeper 
state of unconsciousness by inducing large-amplitude slow oscillations that 
produce prolonged states of neuronal silence.

OBJECTIVE: EEG reactivity is an important predictor of outcome in comatose 
patients. However, visual analysis of reactivity is prone to subjectivity and 
may benefit from quantitative approaches.
: In EEG segments recorded during reactivity testing in 59 comatose 
patients, 13 quantitative EEG parameters were used to compare the spectral 
characteristics of 1-minute segments before and after the onset of stimulation 
(spectral temporal symmetry). Reactivity was quantified with probability values 
estimated using combinations of these parameters. The accuracy of probability 
values as a reactivity classifier was evaluated against the consensus assessment 
of three expert clinical electroencephalographers using visual analysis.
RESULTS: The binary classifier assessing spectral temporal symmetry in four 
frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha and beta) showed best accuracy (Median AUC: 
0.95) and was accompanied by substantial agreement with the individual opinion 
of experts (Gwet's AC1: 65-70%), at least as good as inter-expert agreement 
(AC1: 55%). Probability values also reflected the degree of reactivity, as 
measured by the inter-experts' agreement regarding reactivity for each 
individual case.
CONCLUSION: Automated quantitative EEG approaches based on probabilistic 
description of spectral temporal symmetry reliably quantify EEG reactivity.
SIGNIFICANCE: Quantitative EEG may be useful for evaluating reactivity in 
comatose patients, offering increased objectivity.

BACKGROUND: Burst suppression in mechanically ventilated intensive care unit 
(ICU) patients is associated with increased mortality. However, the relative 
contributions of propofol use and critical illness itself to burst suppression; 
of burst suppression, propofol, and critical illness to mortality; and whether 
preventing burst suppression might reduce mortality, have not been quantified.
: The dataset contains 471 adults from seven ICUs, after excluding anoxic 
encephalopathy due to cardiac arrest or intentional burst suppression for 
therapeutic reasons. We used multiple prediction and causal inference  to 
estimate the effects connecting burst suppression, propofol, critical illness, 
and in-hospital mortality in an observational retrospective study. We also 
estimated the effects mediated by burst suppression. Sensitivity analysis was 
used to assess for unmeasured confounding.
RESULTS: The expected outcomes in a "counterfactual" randomized controlled trial 
(cRCT) that assigned patients to mild versus severe illness are expected to show 
a difference in burst suppression burden of 39%, 95% CI [8-66]%, and in 
mortality of 35% [29-41]%. Assigning patients to maximal (100%) burst 
suppression burden is expected to increase mortality by 12% [7-17]% compared to 
0% burden. Burst suppression mediates 10% [2-21]% of the effect of critical 
illness on mortality. A high cumulative propofol dose (1316 mg/kg) is expected 
to increase burst suppression burden by 6% [0.8-12]% compared to a low dose 
(284 mg/kg). Propofol exposure has no significant direct effect on mortality; 
its effect is entirely mediated through burst suppression.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis clarifies how important factors contribute to 
mortality in ICU patients. Burst suppression appears to contribute to mortality 
but is primarily an effect of critical illness rather than iatrogenic use of 
propofol.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Clinical seizures following acute ischemic stroke (AIS) 
appear to contribute to worse neurologic outcomes. However, the effect of 
electrographic epileptiform abnormalities (EAs) more broadly is less clear. 
Here, we evaluate the impact of EAs, including electrographic seizures and 
periodic and rhythmic patterns, on outcomes in patients with AIS.
: This is a retrospective study of all patients with AIS aged ≥ 18 years 
who underwent at least 18 h of continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring 
at a single center between 2012 and 2017. EAs were classified according to 
American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ACNS) nomenclature and included 
seizures and periodic and rhythmic patterns. EA burden for each 24-h epoch was 
defined using the following cutoffs: EA presence, maximum daily burden < 10% 
versus > 10%, maximum daily burden < 50% versus > 50%, and maximum daily burden 
using categories from ACNS nomenclature ("rare" < 1%; "occasional" 1-9%; 
"frequent" 10-49%; "abundant" 50-89%; "continuous" > 90%). Maximum EA frequency 
for each epoch was dichotomized into ≥ 1.5 Hz versus < 1.5 Hz. Poor neurologic 
outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 4-6 (vs. 0-3 as good 
outcome) at hospital discharge.
RESULTS: One hundred and forty-three patients met study inclusion criteria. 
Sixty-seven patients (46.9%) had EAs. One hundred and twenty-four patients 
(86.7%) had poor outcome. On univariate analysis, the presence of EAs (OR 3.87 
[1.27-11.71], p = 0.024) and maximum daily burden > 10% (OR 12.34 [2.34-210], 
p = 0.001) and > 50% (OR 8.26 [1.34-122], p = 0.035) were associated with worse 
outcomes. On multivariate analysis, after adjusting for clinical covariates 
(age, gender, NIHSS, APACHE II, stroke location, stroke treatment, hemorrhagic 
transformation, Charlson comorbidity index, history of epilepsy), EA presence 
(OR 5.78 [1.36-24.56], p = 0.017), maximum daily burden > 10% (OR 23.69 
[2.43-230.7], p = 0.006), and maximum daily burden > 50% (OR 9.34 [1.01-86.72], 
p = 0.049) were associated with worse outcomes. After adjusting for covariates, 
we also found a dose-dependent association between increasing EA burden and 
increasing probability of poor outcomes (OR 1.89 [1.18-3.03] p = 0.009). We did 
not find an independent association between EA frequency and outcomes (OR: 4.43 
[.98-20.03] p = 0.053). However, the combined effect of increasing EA burden and 
frequency ≥ 1.5 Hz (EA burden * frequency) was significantly associated with 
worse outcomes (OR 1.64 [1.03-2.63] p = 0.039).
CONCLUSIONS: Electrographic seizures and periodic and rhythmic patterns in 
patients with AIS are associated with worse outcomes in a dose-dependent manner. 
Future studies are needed to assess whether treatment of this EEG activity can 
improve outcomes.

BACKGROUND: We investigated the effect of delirium burden in mechanically 
ventilated patients, beginning in the ICU and continuing throughout 
hospitalization, on functional neurologic outcomes up to 2.5 years following 
critical illness.
: Prospective cohort study of enrolling 178 consecutive mechanically 
ventilated adult medical and surgical ICU patients between October 2013 and May 
2016. Altogether, patients were assessed daily for delirium 2941days using the 
Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU). Hospitalization delirium 
burden (DB) was quantified as number of hospital days with delirium divided by 
total days at risk. Survival status up to 2.5 years and neurologic outcomes 
using the Glasgow Outcome Scale were recorded at discharge 3, 6, and 12 months 
post-discharge.
RESULTS: Of 178 patients, 19 (10.7%) were excluded from outcome analyses due to 
persistent coma. Among the remaining 159, 123 (77.4%) experienced delirium. DB 
was independently associated with >4-fold increased mortality at 2.5 years 
following ICU admission (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 4.77; 95% CI, 2.10-10.83; 
P < .001), and worse neurologic outcome at discharge (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 
0.02; 0.01-0.09; P < .001), 3 (aOR, 0.11; 0.04-0.31; P < .001), 6 (aOR, 0.10; 
0.04-0.29; P < .001), and 12 months (aOR, 0.19; 0.07-0.52; P = .001). DB in the 
ICU alone was not associated with mortality (HR, 1.79; 0.93-3.44; P = .082) and 
predicted neurologic outcome less strongly than entire hospital stay DB. 
Similarly, the number of delirium days in the ICU and for whole hospitalization 
were not associated with mortality (HR, 1.00; 0.93-1.08; P = .917 and HR, 0.98; 
0.94-1.03, P = .535) nor with neurological outcomes, except for the association 
between ICU delirium days and neurological outcome at discharge (OR, 0.90; 
0.81-0.99, P = .038).
CONCLUSIONS: Delirium burden throughout hospitalization independently predicts 
long term neurologic outcomes and death up to 2.5 years after critical illness, 
and is more predictive than delirium burden in the ICU alone and number of 
delirium days.

Acute hepatic encephalopathy (AHE) due to acute liver failure is a common form 
of delirium, a state of confusion, impaired attention, and decreased arousal. 
The electroencephalogram (EEG) in AHE often exhibits a striking abnormal pattern 
of brain activity, which epileptiform discharges repeat in a regular repeating 
pattern. This pattern is known as generalized periodic discharges, or 
triphasic-waves (TPWs). While much is known about the neurophysiological 
mechanisms underlying AHE, how these mechanisms relate to TPWs is poorly 
understood. In order to develop hypotheses how TPWs arise, our work builds a 
computational model of AHE (AHE-CM), based on three modifications of the 
well-studied Liley model which emulate mechanisms believed central to brain 
dysfunction in AHE: increased neuronal excitability, impaired synaptic 
transmission, and enhanced postsynaptic inhibition. To relate our AHE-CM to 
clinical EEG data from patients with AHE, we design a model parameter 
optimization method based on particle filtering (PF-POM). Based on results from 
7 AHE patients, we find that the proposed AHE-CM not only performs well in 
reproducing important aspects of the EEG, namely the periodicity of triphasic 
waves (TPWs), but is also helpful in suggesting mechanisms underlying variation 
in EEG patterns seen in AHE. In particular, our model helps explain what 
conditions lead to increased frequency of TPWs. In this way, our model 
represents a starting point for exploring the underlying mechanisms of brain 
dynamics in delirium by relating microscopic mechanisms to EEG patterns.

A cost-effectiveness analysis of nasal surgery to increase continuous positive 
airway pressure adherence in sleep apnea patients with nasal obstruction.

School, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.A.

OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Nasal surgery has been implicated to improve continuous 
positive airway pressure (CPAP) compliance in patients with obstructive sleep 
apnea (OSA) and nasal obstruction. However, the cost-effectiveness of nasal 
surgery to improve CPAP compliance is not known. We modeled the 
cost-effectiveness of two types of nasal surgery versus no surgery in patients 
with OSA and nasal obstruction undergoing CPAP therapy.
STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness decision tree model.
: We built a decision tree model to identify conditions under which nasal 
surgery would be cost-effective to improve CPAP adherence over the standard of 
care. We compared turbinate reduction and septoplasty to nonsurgical treatment 
over varied time horizons from a third-party payer perspective. We included 
variables for cost of untreated OSA, surgical cost and complications, improved 
compliance postoperatively, and quality of life.
RESULTS: Our study identified nasal surgery as a cost-effective strategy to 
improve compliance of OSA patients using CPAP across a range of plausible model 
assumptions regarding the cost of untreated OSA, the probability of adherence 
improvement, and a chronic time horizon. The relatively lower surgical cost of 
turbinate reduction made it more cost-effective at earlier time horizons, 
whereas septoplasty became cost-effective after a longer timespan.
CONCLUSIONS: Across a range of plausible values in a clinically relevant 
decision model, nasal surgery is a cost-effective strategy to improve CPAP 
compliance in OSA patients with nasal obstruction. Our results suggest that OSA 
patients with nasal obstruction who struggle with CPAP therapy compliance should 
undergo evaluation for nasal surgery.

Stimulus information stored in lasting active and hidden network states is 
destroyed by network bursts.

In both humans and animals brief synchronizing bursts of epileptiform activity 
known as interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) can, even in the absence of 
overt seizures, cause transient cognitive impairments (TCI) that include 
problems with perception or short-term memory. While no evidence from single 
units is available, it has been assumed that IEDs destroy information 
represented in neuronal networks. Cultured neuronal networks are a model for 
generic cortical microcircuits, and their spontaneous activity is characterized 
by the presence of synchronized network bursts (SNBs), which share a number of 
properties with IEDs, including the high degree of synchronization and their 
spontaneous occurrence in the absence of an external stimulus. As a model 
approach to understanding the processes underlying IEDs, optogenetic stimulation 
and multielectrode array (MEA) recordings of cultured neuronal networks were 
used to study whether stimulus information represented in these networks 
survives SNBs. When such networks are optically stimulated they encode and 
maintain stimulus information for as long as one second. Experiments involved 
recording the network response to a single stimulus and trials where two 
different stimuli were presented sequentially, akin to a paired pulse trial. We 
broke the sequential stimulus trials into encoding, delay and readout phases and 
found that regardless of which phase the SNB occurs, stimulus-specific 
information was impaired. SNBs were observed to increase the mean network firing 
rate, but this did not translate monotonically into increases in network 
entropy. It was found that the more excitable a network, the more stereotyped 
its response was during a network burst. These measurements speak to whether 
SNBs are capable of transmitting information in addition to blocking it. These 
results are consistent with previous reports and provide baseline predictions 
concerning the neural mechanisms by which IEDs might cause TCI.

electroencephalography.

Functional connectivity networks have become a central focus in neuroscience 
because they reveal key higher-dimensional features of normal and abnormal 
nervous system physiology. Functional networks reflect activity-based coupling 
between brain regions that may be constrained by relatively static anatomical 
connections, yet these networks appear to support tremendously dynamic 
behaviors. Within this growing field, the stability and temporal characteristics 
of functional connectivity brain networks have not been well characterized. We 
evaluated the temporal stability of spontaneous functional connectivity networks 
derived from multi-day scalp encephalogram (EEG) recordings in five healthy 
human subjects. Topological stability and graph characteristics of networks 
derived from averaged data epochs ranging from 1 s to multiple hours across 
different states of consciousness were compared. We show that, although 
functional networks are highly variable on the order of seconds, stable network 
templates emerge after as little as ∼100 s of recording and persist across 
different states and frequency bands (albeit with slightly different 
characteristics in different states and frequencies). Within these network 
templates, the most common edges are markedly consistent, constituting a network 
"core." Although average network topologies persist across time, measures of 
global network connectivity, density and clustering coefficient, are state and 
frequency specific, with sparsest but most highly clustered networks seen during 
sleep and in the gamma frequency band. These findings support the notion that a 
core functional organization underlies spontaneous cortical processing and may 
provide a reference template on which unstable, transient, and rapidly adaptive 
long-range assemblies are overlaid in a frequency-dependent manner.

Should risky treatments be reserved for secondary prevention? Theoretical 
considerations regarding risk-benefit tradeoffs.

Westover MB, Eiseman NA, Bianchi MT.

 information:
Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, 
USA.

OBJECTIVE: Clinical intuition suggests that risk-reducing treatments are more 
beneficial for patients with greater risk of disease. This intuition contributes 
to our rationale for tolerating greater adverse event risk in the setting of 
secondary prevention of certain diseases such as myocardial infarction or 
stroke. However, under certain conditions treatment benefits may be greater in 
primary prevention, even when the treatment carries harmful adverse effect 
potential.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We present simple decision-theoretic models that 
illustrate conditions of risk and benefit under which a treatment is predicted 
to be more beneficial in primary than in secondary prevention.
RESULTS: The models cover a spectrum of possible clinical circumstances, and 
demonstrate that net benefit in primary prevention can occur despite no benefit 
(or even net harm) in secondary prevention.
CONCLUSION: This framework provides a rationale for extending the familiar 
concept of balancing risks and benefits to account for disease-specific 
considerations of primary vs. secondary prevention.

Information theoretic quantification of diagnostic uncertainty.

Westover MB, Eiseman NA, Cash SS, Bianchi MT.

 information:
Neurology Department, Massachusetts General Hospital, Wang 720, Boston, MA 
02114, USA.

Diagnostic test interpretation remains a challenge in clinical practice. Most 
physicians receive training in the use of Bayes' rule, which specifies how the 
sensitivity and specificity of a test for a given disease combine with the 
pre-test probability to quantify the change in disease probability incurred by a 
new test result. However, multiple studies demonstrate physicians' deficiencies 
in probabilistic reasoning, especially with unexpected test results. Information 
theory, a branch of probability theory dealing explicitly with the 
quantification of uncertainty, has been proposed as an alternative framework for 
diagnostic test interpretation, but is even less familiar to physicians. We have 
previously addressed one key challenge in the practical application of Bayes 
theorem: the handling of uncertainty in the critical first step of estimating 
the pre-test probability of disease. This essay aims to present the essential 
concepts of information theory to physicians in an accessible manner, and to 
extend previous work regarding uncertainty in pre-test probability estimation by 
placing this type of uncertainty within a principled information theoretic 
framework. We address several obstacles hindering physicians' application of 
information theoretic concepts to diagnostic test interpretation. These include 
issues of terminology (mathematical meanings of certain information theoretic 
terms differ from clinical or common parlance) as well as the underlying 
mathematical assumptions. Finally, we illustrate how, in information theoretic 
terms, one can understand the effect on diagnostic uncertainty of considering 
ranges instead of simple point estimates of pre-test probability.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the potential impact of aspirin therapy for long-term 
secondary prevention after stroke of undetermined etiology in resource-limited 
settings without access to neuroimaging to distinguish ischemic stroke from 
intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).
: We conducted a decision analysis using a Markov state transition model. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed across the worldwide reported range of the 
proportion of strokes due to ICH and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of 
aspirin-associated relative risks in patients with ICH.
RESULTS: For patients with stroke of undetermined etiology, long-term aspirin 
was the preferred treatment strategy across the worldwide reported range of the 
proportion of strokes due to ICH. At 34% of strokes due to ICH (the highest 
proportion reported in a large epidemiologic study), the benefit of aspirin 
remained beyond the upper bounds of the 95% CIs of aspirin-associated post-ICH 
relative risks most concerning to clinicians (ICH recurrence risk and mortality 
risk if ICH recurs on aspirin). Based on the estimated 11,590,204 strokes in 
low- and middle-income countries in 2010, our model predicts that aspirin 
therapy for secondary stroke prevention in all patients with stroke in these 
countries could lead to an estimated yearly decrease of 84,492 recurrent strokes 
and 4,056 stroke-related mortalities.
CONCLUSIONS: The concern that the risks of aspirin in patients with stroke of 
unknown etiology could outweigh the benefits is not supported by our model, 
which predicts that aspirin for secondary prevention in patients with stroke of 
undetermined etiology in resource-limited settings could lead to decreased 
stroke-related mortality and stroke recurrence.

Burst suppression is an EEG pattern characterized by alternating periods of 
high-amplitude activity (bursts) and relatively low amplitude activity 
(suppressions). Burst suppression can arise from several different pathological 
conditions, as well as from general anesthesia. Here we review current 
algorithms that are used to quantify burst suppression, its various etiologies, 
and possible underlying mechanisms. We then review clinical applications of 
anesthetic-induced burst suppression. Finally, we report the results of our new 
study showing clear electrophysiological differences in burst suppression 
patterns induced by two common general anesthetics, sevoflurane and propofol. 
Our data suggest that the circuit mechanisms that generate burst suppression 
activity may differ among general anesthetics.

Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114, USA.

Seizures are known to occur in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). In the setting 
of a rapidly progressive condition with no effective therapy, determining 
appropriate treatment for seizures can be difficult if clinical morbidity is not 
obvious yet the electroencephalogram (EEG) demonstrates a worrisome pattern such 
as status epilepticus. Herein, we present the case of a 39-year-old man with CJD 
and electrographic seizures, discuss how this case challenges conventional 
definitions of seizures, and discuss a rational approach toward treatment. 
Coincidentally, our case is the first report of CJD in a patient with Stickler 
syndrome.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a computational method to detect and quantify burst 
suppression patterns (BSP) in the EEGs of critical care patients. A multi-center 
validation study was performed to assess the detection performance of the 
method.
: The fully automatic method scans the EEG for discontinuous patterns and 
shows detected BSP and quantitative information on a trending display in 
real-time. The method is designed to work without setting any patient specific 
parameters and to be insensitive to EEG artifacts and periodic patterns. For 
validation a total of 3982 h of EEG from 88 patients were analyzed from three 
centers. Each EEG was annotated by two reviewers to assess the detection 
performance and the inter-rater agreement.
RESULTS: Average inter-rater agreement between pairs of reviewers was κ=0.69. On 
average 22% of the review segments included BSP. An average sensitivity of 90% 
and a specificity of 84% were measured on the consensus annotations of two 
reviewers. More than 95% of the periodic patterns in the EEGs were correctly 
suppressed.
CONCLUSION: A fully automatic method to detect burst suppression patterns was 
assessed in a multi-center study. The method showed high sensitivity and 
specificity.
SIGNIFICANCE: Clinically applicable burst suppression detection method validated 
in a large multi-center study.

Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is the most common and disabling complication 
among patients admitted to the hospital for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). 
Clinical and radiographic  often fail to detect DCI early enough to avert 
irreversible injury. We assessed the clinical feasibility of implementing a 
continuous EEG (cEEG) ischemia monitoring service for early DCI detection as 
part of an institutional guideline. An institutional neuromonitoring guideline 
was designed by an interdisciplinary team of neurocritical care, clinical 
neurophysiology, and neurosurgery physicians and nursing staff and cEEG 
technologists. The interdisciplinary team focused on  selection criteria of 
high-risk patients, (2) minimization of safety concerns related to prolonged 
monitoring, (3) technical selection of quantitative and qualitative 
neurophysiologic parameters based on expert consensus and review of the 
literature, (4) a structured interpretation and reporting methodology, prompting 
direct patient evaluation and iterative neurocritical care, and (5) a 
two-layered quality assurance process including structured clinician interviews 
assessing events of neurologic worsening and an adjudicated consensus review of 
neuroimaging and medical records. The resulting guideline's clinical feasibility 
was then prospectively evaluated. The institutional SAH monitoring guideline 
used transcranial Doppler ultrasound and cEEG monitoring for vasospasm and 
ischemia monitoring in patients with either Fisher group 3 or Hunt-Hess grade IV 
or V SAH. Safety criteria focused on prevention of skin breakdown and agitation. 
Technical components included monitoring of transcranial Doppler ultrasound 
velocities and cEEG features, including quantitative alpha:delta ratio and 
percent alpha variability, qualitative evidence of new focal slowing, late-onset 
epileptiform activity, or overall worsening of background. Structured cEEG 
reports were introduced including verbal communication for findings concerning 
neurologic decline. The guideline was successfully implemented over 27 months, 
during which neurocritical care physicians referred 71 SAH patients for combined 
transcranial Doppler ultrasound and cEEG monitoring. The quality assurance 
process determined a DCI rate of 48% among the monitored population, more than 
90% of which occurred during the duration of cEEG monitoring (mean 6.9 days) 
beginning 2.7 days after symptom onset. An institutional guideline implementing 
cEEG for SAH ischemia monitoring and reporting is feasible to implement and 
efficiently identify patients at high baseline risk of DCI during the period of 
monitoring.

Interrater Agreement for Consensus Definitions of Delayed Ischemic Events After 
Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.

Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.A.; †Department of Neurology, Université 
Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium; ‡Department of Neurology, Yale University 
School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, U.S.A.; and §Department of Neurology 
and Rehabilitation Medicine, UC College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S.A.

BACKGROUND: Thirty percent of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage experience 
delayed cerebral ischemia or delayed ischemic neurologic decline (DIND). 
Variability in the definitions of delayed ischemia makes outcome studies 
difficult to compare. A recent consensus statement advocates standardized 
definitions for delayed ischemia in clinical trials of subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
We sought to evaluate the interrater agreement of these definitions.
: Based on consensus definitions, we assessed for:  delayed cerebral 
infarction, defined as radiographic cerebral infarction; (2) DIND type 1 
(DIND1), defined as focal neurologic decline; and (3) DIND2, defined as a global 
decline in arousal. Five neurologists retrospectively reviewed electronic 
records of 58 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Three reviewers had access 
to and reviewed neuroradiology imaging. We assessed interrater agreement using 
the Gwet kappa statistic.
RESULTS: Interrater agreement statistics were excellent (95.83%) for overall 
agreement on the presence or absence of any delayed ischemic event (DIND1, 
DIND2, or delayed cerebral infarction). Agreement was "moderate" for 
specifically identifying DIND1 (56.58%) and DIND2 (48.66%) events. We observed 
greater agreement for DIND1 when there was a significant focal motor decline of 
at least 1 point in the motor score. There was fair agreement (39.20%) for 
identifying delayed cerebral infarction; CT imaging was the predominant 
modality.
CONCLUSIONS: Consensus definitions for delayed cerebral ischemia yielded 
near-perfect overall agreement and can thus be applied in future large-scale 
studies. However, a strict process of adjudication, explicit thresholds for 
determining focal neurologic decline, and MRI techniques that better 
discriminate edema from infarction seem critical for reproducibility of 
determination of specific outcome phenotypes, and will be important for 
successful clinical trials.

OBJECTIVE: Hypoxic brain injury is the largest contributor to disability and 
mortality after cardiac arrest. We aim to identify electroencephalogram (EEG) 
characteristics that can predict outcome on cardiac arrest patients treated with 
targeted temperature management (TTM).
: We retrospectively examined clinical, EEG, functional outcome at 
discharge, and in-hospital mortality for 373 adult subjects with return of 
spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest. Poor outcome was defined as a 
Cerebral Performance Category score of 3-5. Pure suppression-burst (SB) was 
defined as SB not associated with status epilepticus (SE), seizures, or 
generalized periodic discharges.
RESULTS: In-hospital mortality was 68.6% (N=256). Presence of both unreactive 
EEG background and SE was associated with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 
100% (95% confidence interval: 0.96-1) and a false-positive rate (FPR) of 0% 
(95% CI: 0-0.11) for poor functional outcome. A prediction model including 
demographics data, admission exam, presence of status epilepticus, pure SB, and 
lack of EEG reactivity had an area under the curve of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.87-0.95) 
for poor functional outcome prediction, and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.94-0.98) for 
in-hospital mortality. Presence of pure SB (N=87) was confounded by anesthetics 
use in 83.9% of the cases, and was not an independent predictor of poor 
functional outcome, having a FPR of 23% (95% CI: 0.19-0.28).
CONCLUSIONS: An unreactive EEG background and SE predicted poor functional 
outcome and in-hospital mortality in cardiac arrest patients undergoing TTM. 
Prognostic value of pure SB is confounded by use of sedative agents, and its use 
on prognostication decisions should be made with caution.

OBJECTIVES: Basic science and clinical studies suggest that sleep disturbance 
may be a modifiable risk factor for postoperative delirium. We aimed to assess 
the association between preoperative sleep disturbance and postoperative 
delirium.
DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane 
from inception until May 31, 2017.
STUDY SELECTION: We performed a systematic search of the literature for all 
studies that reported on sleep disruption and postoperative delirium excluding 
cross-sectional studies, case reports, and studies not reported in English 
language.
DATA EXTRACTION: Two s independently performed study selection and data 
extraction. We calculated pooled effects estimates with a random-effects model 
constructed in Stata and evaluated the risk of bias by formal testing (Stata 
Corp V.14, College Station, TX), DATA SYNTHESIS:: We included 12 studies, from 
1,238 citations that met our inclusion criteria. The pooled odds ratio for the 
association between sleep disturbance and postoperative delirium was 5.24 (95% 
CI, 3.61-7.60; p < 0.001 and I = 0.0%; p = 0.76). The pooled risk ratio for the 
association between sleep disturbance and postoperative delirium in prospective 
studies (n = 6) was 2.90 (95% CI, 2.28-3.69; p < 0.001 and I = 0.0%; p = 0.89). 
The odds ratio associated with obstructive sleep apnea and unspecified types of 
sleep disorder were 4.75 (95% CI, 2.65-8.54; p < 0.001 and I = 0.0%; p = 0.85) 
and 5.60 (95% CI, 3.46-9.07; p < 0.001 and I = 0.0%; p = 0.41), respectively. We 
performed Begg's and Egger's tests for publication bias and confirmed a null 
result for publication bias (p = 0.371 and 0.103, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Preexisting sleep disturbances are likely associated with 
postoperative delirium. Whether system-level initiatives targeting patients with 
preoperative sleep disturbance may help reduce the prevalence, morbidity, and 
healthcare costs associated with postoperative delirium remains to be 
determined.

OBJECTIVES: Absence of somatosensory evoked potentials is considered a nearly 
perfect predictor of poor outcome after cardiac arrest. However, reports of good 
outcomes despite absent somatosensory evoked potentials and high rates of 
withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies have raised concerns that estimates of 
the prognostic value of absent somatosensory evoked potentials may be biased by 
self-fulfilling prophecies. We aimed to develop an unbiased estimate of the 
false positive rate of absent somatosensory evoked potentials as a predictor of 
poor outcome after cardiac arrest.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed.
STUDY SELECTION: We selected 35 studies in cardiac arrest prognostication that 
reported somatosensory evoked potentials.
DATA EXTRACTION: In each study, we identified rates of withdrawal of 
life-sustaining therapies and good outcomes despite absent somatosensory evoked 
potentials. We appraised studies for potential biases using the Quality in 
Prognosis Studies tool. Using these data, we developed a statistical model to 
estimate the false positive rate of absent somatosensory evoked potentials 
adjusted for withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies rate.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Two-thousand one-hundred thirty-three subjects underwent 
somatosensory evoked potential testing. Five-hundred ninety-four had absent 
somatosensory evoked potentials; of these, 14 had good functional outcomes. The 
rate of withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies for subjects with absent 
somatosensory evoked potential could be estimated in 14 of the 35 studies (mean 
80%, median 100%). The false positive rate for absent somatosensory evoked 
potential in predicting poor neurologic outcome, adjusted for a withdrawal of 
life-sustaining therapies rate of 80%, is 7.7% (95% CI, 4-13%).
CONCLUSIONS: Absent cortical somatosensory evoked potentials do not infallibly 
predict poor outcome in patients with coma following cardiac arrest. The chances 
of survival in subjects with absent somatosensory evoked potentials, though low, 
may be substantially higher than generally believed.

BACKGROUND: Finding interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in the EEG is a 
part of diagnosing epilepsy. Automated software for annotating EEGs of patients 
with suspected epilepsy can therefore help with reaching a diagnosis. A large 
amount of data is required for training and evaluating an effective IED 
detection system. IEDs occur infrequently in the most patients' EEG, therefore, 
interictal EEG recordings contain mostly background waveforms.
NEW METHOD: As the first step to detect IEDs, we propose a machine learning 
technique eliminating most EEG background data using an ensemble of simple fast 
classifiers based on several EEG features. This could save computation time for 
an IED detection method, allowing the remaining waveforms to be classified by 
more computationally intensive . We consider several efficient features 
and reject background by applying thresholds on them in consecutive steps.
RESULTS: We applied the proposed algorithm on a dataset of 156 EEGs (93 and 63 
with and without IEDs, respectively). We were able to eliminate 78% of 
background waveforms while retaining 97% of IEDs on our cross-validated dataset.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING : We applied support vector machine, k-nearest 
neighbours, and random forest classifiers to detect IEDs with and without 
initial background rejection. Results show that rejecting background by our 
proposed method speeds up the overall classification by a factor ranging from 
1.8 to 4.7 for the considered classifiers.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method successfully reduces computation time of an IED 
detection system. Therefore, it is beneficial in speeding up IED detection 
especially when utilizing large EEG datasets.

OBJECTIVE: Electroencephalogram (EEG) reactivity is a robust predictor of 
neurological recovery after cardiac arrest, however interrater-agreement among 
electroencephalographers is limited. We sought to evaluate the performance of 
machine learning  using EEG reactivity data to predict good long-term 
outcomes in hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.
: We retrospectively reviewed clinical and EEG data of comatose cardiac 
arrest subjects. Electroencephalogram reactivity was tested within 72 h from 
cardiac arrest using sound and pain stimuli. A Quantitative EEG (QEEG) 
reactivity method evaluated changes in QEEG features (EEG spectra, entropy, and 
frequency features) during the 10 s before and after each stimulation. Good 
outcome was defined as Cerebral Performance Category of 1-2 at six months. 
Performance of a random forest classifier was compared against a penalized 
general linear model (GLM) and expert electroencephalographer review.
RESULTS: Fifty subjects were included and sixteen (32%) had good outcome. Both 
QEEG reactivity  had comparable performance to expert EEG reactivity 
assessment for good outcome prediction (mean AUC 0.8 for random forest vs. 0.69 
for GLM vs. 0.69 for expert review, respectively; p non-significant).
CONCLUSIONS: Machine-learning models utilizing quantitative EEG reactivity data 
can predict long-term outcome after cardiac arrest.
SIGNIFICANCE: A quantitative approach to EEG reactivity assessment may support 
prognostication in cardiac arrest.

CLASSIFIER CASCADE TO AID IN DETECTION OF EPILEPTIFORM TRANSIENTS IN INTERICTAL 
EEG.

The presence of Epileptiform Transients (ET) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) 
is a key finding in the medical workup of a patient with suspected epilepsy. 
Automated ET detection can increase the uniformity and speed of ET detection. 
Current ET detection  suffer from insufficient precision and high false 
positive rates. Since ETs occur infrequently in the EEG of most patients, the 
majority of recordings comprise background EEG waveforms. In this work we 
establish a method to exclude as much background data as possible from EEG 
recordings by applying a classifier cascade. The remaining data can then be 
classified using other ET detection . We compare a single Support Vector 
Machine (SVM) to a cascade of SVMs for detecting ETs. Our results show that the 
precision and false positive rate improve significantly by incorporating a 
classifier cascade before ET detection. Our method can help improve the 
precision and false positive rate of an ET detection system. At a fixed 
sensitivity, we were able to improve precision by 6.78%; and at a fixed false 
positive rate, the sensitivity improved by 2.83%.

Improved tracking of sevoflurane anesthetic states with drug-specific machine 
learning models.

General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, United States of America.

OBJECTIVE: The ability to monitor anesthetic states using automated approaches 
is expected to reduce inaccurate drug dosing and side-effects. Commercially 
available anesthetic state monitors perform poorly when ketamine is administered 
as an anesthetic-analgesic adjunct. Poor performance is likely because the 
models underlying these monitors are not optimized for the electroencephalogram 
(EEG) oscillations that are unique to the co-administration of ketamine.
APPROACH: In this work, we designed two k-nearest neighbors algorithms for 
anesthetic state prediction.
MAIN RESULTS: The first algorithm was trained only on sevoflurane EEG data, 
making it sevoflurane-specific. This algorithm enabled discrimination of the 
sevoflurane general anesthesia (GA) state from sedated and awake states (true 
positive rate = 0.87, [95% CI, 0.76, 0.97]). However, it did not enable 
discrimination of the sevoflurane-plus-ketamine GA state from sedated and awake 
states (true positive rate = 0.43, [0.19, 0.67]). In our second algorithm, we 
implemented a cross drug training paradigm by including both sevoflurane and 
sevoflurane-plus-ketamine EEG data in our training set. This algorithm enabled 
discrimination of the sevoflurane-plus-ketamine GA state from sedated and awake 
states (true positive rate = 0.91, [0.84, 0.98]).
SIGNIFICANCE: Instead of a one-algorithm-fits-all-drugs approach to anesthetic 
state monitoring, our results suggest that drug-specific models are necessary to 
improve the performance of automated anesthetic state monitors.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Acute brain injury (ABI) is a broad category of pathologies, 
including traumatic brain injury, and is commonly complicated by seizures. 
Electroencephalogram (EEG) studies are used to detect seizures or other 
epileptiform patterns. This review seeks to clarify EEG findings relevant to 
ABI, explore practical barriers limiting EEG implementation, discuss strategies 
to leverage EEG monitoring in various clinical settings, and suggest an approach 
to utilize EEG for triage.
RECENT FINDINGS: Current literature suggests there is an increased morbidity and 
mortality risk associated with seizures or patterns on the ictal-interictal 
continuum (IIC) due to ABI. Further, increased use of EEG is associated with 
better clinical outcomes. However, there are many logistical barriers to 
successful EEG implementation that prohibit its ubiquitous use. Solutions to 
these limitations include the use of rapid EEG systems, non-expert EEG analysis, 
machine learning algorithms, and the incorporation of EEG data into prognostic 
models.

BACKGROUND: Patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) with 
electroencephalographic epileptiform activity (seizures, periodic and rhythmic 
patterns, and sporadic discharges) are frequently treated with antiseizure 
medications (ASMs). However, the safety and effectiveness of ASM treatment for 
epileptiform activity has not been established. We used observational data to 
investigate the effectiveness of ASM treatment in patients with aSAH undergoing 
continuous electroencephalography (cEEG) to develop a causal hypothesis for 
testing in prospective trials.
: This was a retrospective single-center cohort study of patients with 
aSAH admitted between 2011 and 2016. Patients underwent ≥ 24 h of cEEG within 
4 days of admission. All patients received primary ASM prophylaxis until 
aneurysm treatment (typically within 24 h of admission). Treatment exposure was 
defined as reinitiation of ASMs after aneurysm treatment and cEEG initiation. We 
excluded patients with non-cEEG indications for ASMs (e.g., epilepsy, acute 
symptomatic seizures). Outcomes measures were 90-day mortality and good 
functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale scores 0-3). Propensity scores were 
used to adjust for baseline covariates and disease severity.
RESULTS: Ninety-four patients were eligible (40 continued ASM treatment; 54 
received prophylaxis only). ASM continuation was not significantly associated 
with higher 90-day mortality (propensity-adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 2.01 [95% 
confidence interval (CI) 0.57-7.02]). ASM continuation was associated with lower 
likelihood for 90-day good functional outcome (propensity-adjusted HR = 0.39 
[95% CI 0.18-0.81]). In a secondary analysis, low-intensity treatment (low-dose 
single ASM) was not significantly associated with mortality (propensity-adjusted 
HR = 0.60 [95% CI 0.10-3.59]), although it was associated with a lower 
likelihood of good outcome (propensity-adjusted HR = 0.37 [95% CI 0.15-0.91]), 
compared with prophylaxis. High-intensity treatment (high-dose single ASM, 
multiple ASMs, or anesthetics) was associated with higher mortality 
(propensity-adjusted HR = 6.80 [95% CI 1.67-27.65]) and lower likelihood for 
good outcomes (propensity-adjusted HR = 0.30 [95% CI 0.10-0.94]) compared with 
prophylaxis only.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest the testable hypothesis that continuing ASMs 
in patients with aSAH with cEEG abnormalities does not improve functional 
outcomes. This hypothesis should be tested in prospective randomized studies.

BACKGROUND: Studies of neurologic outcomes have found conflicting results 
regarding differences between patients with substance-related cardiac arrests 
(SRCA) and non-SRCA. We investigate the effects of SRCA on severe cerebral edema 
development, a neuroimaging intermediate endpoint for neurologic injury.
: 327 out-of-hospital comatose cardiac arrest patients were 
retrospectively analyzed. Demographics and baseline clinical characteristics 
were examined. SRCA categorization was based on admission toxicology screens. 
Severe cerebral edema classification was based on radiology reports. Poor 
clinical outcomes were defined as discharge Cerebral Performance Category 
scores > 3.
RESULTS: SRCA patients (N = 86) were younger (P < 0.001), and more likely to 
have non-shockable rhythms (P < 0.001), be unwitnessed (P < 0.001), lower 
Glasgow Coma Scale scores (P < 0.001), absent brainstem reflexes (P < 0.05) and 
develop severe cerebral edema (P < 0.001) than non-SRCA patients (N = 241). 
Multivariable analyses found younger age (P < 0.001), female sex (P = 0.008), 
non-shockable rhythm (P = 0.01) and SRCA (P = 0.05) to be predictors of severe 
cerebral edema development. Older age (P < 0.001), non-shockable rhythm 
(P = 0.02), severe cerebral edema (P < 0.001), and absent pupillary light 
reflexes (P = 0.004) were predictors of poor outcomes. SRCA patients had higher 
proportion of brain deaths (P < 0.001) compared to non-SRCA patients.
CONCLUSIONS: SRCA results in higher rates of severe cerebral edema development 
and brain death. The absence of statistically significant differences in 
discharge outcomes or survival between SRCA and non-SRCA patients may be related 
to the higher rate of withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment (WLST) in the 
non-SRCA group. Future neuroprognostic studies may opt to include neuroimaging 
markers as intermediate measures of neurologic injury which are not influenced 
by WLST decisions.

OBJECTIVE: To determine cost-effectiveness parameters for EEG monitoring in 
cardiac arrest prognostication.
: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis to estimate the cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained by adding continuous EEG monitoring to 
standard cardiac arrest prognostication using the American Academy of Neurology 
Practice Parameter (AANPP) decision algorithm: neurologic examination, 
somatosensory evoked potentials, and neuron-specific enolase. We explored 
lifetime cost-effectiveness in a closed system that incorporates revenue back 
into the medical system (return) from payers who survive a cardiac arrest with 
good outcome and contribute to the health system during the remaining years of 
life. Good outcome was defined as a Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score of 
1-2 and poor outcome as CPC of 3-5.
RESULTS: An improvement in specificity for poor outcome prediction of 4.2% would 
be sufficient to make continuous EEG monitoring cost-effective (baseline AANPP 
specificity = 83.9%). In sensitivity analysis, the effect of increased 
sensitivity on the cost-effectiveness of EEG depends on the utility (u) assigned 
to a poor outcome. For patients who regard surviving with a poor outcome (CPC 
3-4) worse than death (u = -0.34), an increased sensitivity for poor outcome 
prediction of 13.8% would make AANPP + EEG monitoring cost-effective (baseline 
AANPP sensitivity = 76.3%). In the closed system, an improvement in sensitivity 
of 1.8% together with an improvement in specificity of 3% was sufficient to make 
AANPP + EEG monitoring cost-effective, assuming lifetime return of 50% (USD 
$70,687).
CONCLUSION: Incorporating continuous EEG monitoring into cardiac arrest 
prognostication is cost-effective if relatively small improvements in 
sensitivity and specificity are achieved.

Boston, MA 02114, USA.

Identifying predictors of subjective sleepiness and severity of sleep apnea are 
important yet challenging goals in sleep medicine. Classification algorithms may 
provide insights, especially when large data sets are available. We analyzed 
polysomnography and clinical features available from the Sleep Heart Health 
Study. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the apnea-hypopnea index were the 
targets of three classifiers: k-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes and support vector 
machine algorithms. Classification was based on up to 26 features including 
demographics, polysomnogram, and electrocardiogram (spectrogram). Naive Bayes 
was best for predicting abnormal Epworth class (0-10 versus 11-24), although 
prediction was weak: polysomnogram features had 16.7% sensitivity and 88.8% 
specificity; spectrogram features had 5.3% sensitivity and 96.5% specificity. 
The support vector machine performed similarly to naive Bayes for predicting 
sleep apnea class (0-5 versus >5): 59.0% sensitivity and 74.5% specificity using 
clinical features and 43.4% sensitivity and 83.5% specificity using 
spectrographic features compared with the naive Bayes classifier, which had 
57.5% sensitivity and 73.7% specificity (clinical), and 39.0% sensitivity and 
82.7% specificity (spectrogram). Mutual information analysis confirmed the 
minimal dependency of the Epworth score on any feature, while the apnea-hypopnea 
index showed modest dependency on body mass index, arousal index, oxygenation 
and spectrogram features. Apnea classification was modestly accurate, using 
either clinical or spectrogram features, and showed lower sensitivity and higher 
specificity than common sleep apnea screening tools. Thus, clinical prediction 
of sleep apnea may be feasible with easily obtained demographic and 
electrocardiographic analysis, but the utility of the Epworth is questioned by 
its minimal relation to clinical, electrocardiographic, or polysomnographic 
features.

    medRxiv. 2020 Jul 24;:

We evaluated the incidence, distribution, and histopathologic correlates of 
microvascular brain lesions in patients with severe COVID-19. Sixteen 
consecutive patients admitted to the intensive care unit with severe COVID-19 
undergoing brain MRI for evaluation of coma or neurologic deficits were 
retrospectively identified. Eleven patients had punctate susceptibility-weighted 
imaging (SWI) lesions in the subcortical and deep white matter, eight patients 
had >10 SWI lesions, and four patients had lesions involving the corpus 
callosum. The distribution of SWI lesions was similar to that seen in patients 
with hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis, and disseminated intravascular 
coagulation. Brain autopsy in one patient revealed that SWI lesions corresponded 
to widespread microvascular injury, characterized by perivascular and 
parenchymal petechial hemorrhages and microscopic ischemic lesions. 
Collectively, these radiologic and histopathologic findings add to growing 
evidence that patients with severe COVID-19 are at risk for multifocal 
microvascular hemorrhagic and ischemic lesions in the subcortical and deep white 
matter.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is the leading 
complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Because DCI was traditionally 
thought to be caused by large vessel vasospasm, transcranial Doppler ultrasounds 
(TCDs) have been the standard of care. Continuous EEG has emerged as a promising 
complementary monitoring modality and predicts increased DCI risk. Our objective 
was to determine whether combining EEG and TCD data improves prediction of DCI 
after SAH. We hypothesize that integrating these diagnostic modalities improves 
DCI prediction.
: We retrospectively assessed patients with moderate to severe SAH 
(2011-2015; Fisher 3-4 or Hunt-Hess 4-5) who had both prospective TCD and EEG 
acquisition during hospitalization. Middle cerebral artery (MCA) peak systolic 
velocities (PSVs) and the presence or absence of epileptiform abnormalities 
(EAs), defined as seizures, epileptiform discharges, and rhythmic/periodic 
activity, were recorded daily. Logistic regressions were used to identify 
significant covariates of EAs and TCD to predict DCI. Group-based trajectory 
modeling (GBTM) was used to account for changes over time by identifying 
distinct group trajectories of MCA PSV and EAs associated with DCI risk.
RESULTS: We assessed 107 patients; DCI developed in 56 (51.9%). Univariate 
predictors of DCI are presence of high-MCA velocity (PSV ≥200 cm/s, sensitivity 
27%, specificity 89%) and EAs (sensitivity 66%, specificity 62%) on or before 
day 3. Two univariate GBTM trajectories of EAs predicted DCI (sensitivity 64%, 
specificity 62.75%). Logistic regression and GBTM models using both TCD and EEG 
monitoring performed better. The best logistic regression and GBTM models used 
both TCD and EEG data, Hunt-Hess score at admission, and aneurysm treatment as 
predictors of DCI (logistic regression: sensitivity 90%, specificity 70%; GBTM: 
sensitivity 89%, specificity 67%).
DISCUSSION: EEG and TCD biomarkers combined provide the best prediction of DCI. 
The conjunction of clinical variables with the timing of EAs and high MCA 
velocities improved model performance. These results suggest that TCD and cEEG 
are promising complementary monitoring modalities for DCI prediction. Our model 
has potential to serve as a decision support tool in SAH management.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that combined 
TCD and EEG monitoring can identify delayed cerebral ischemia after SAH.

PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has significantly impacted 
healthcare delivery and utilization. The aim of this article was to assess the 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on in-hospital continuous electroencephalography 
(cEEG) utilization and identify areas for process improvement.
: A 38-question web-based survey was distributed to site principal 
investigators of the Critical Care EEG Monitoring Research Consortium, and 
institutional contacts for the Neurodiagnostic Credentialing and Accreditation 
Board. The survey addressed the following aspects of cEEG utilization:  
general center characteristics, (2) cEEG utilization and review, (3) staffing 
and workflow, and (4) health impact on EEG technologists.
RESULTS: The survey was open from June 12, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and distributed 
to 174 centers with 79 responses (45.4%). Forty centers were located in COVID-19 
hotspots. Fifty-seven centers (72.1%) reported cEEG volume reduction. Centers in 
the Northeast were most likely to report cEEG volume reduction (odds ratio [OR] 
7.19 [1.53-33.83]; P = 0.012). Additionally, centers reporting decrease in 
outside hospital transfers reported cEEG volume reduction; OR 21.67 
[4.57-102.81]; P ≤ 0.0001. Twenty-six centers (32.91%) reported reduction in EEG 
technologist coverage. Eighteen centers had personal protective equipment 
shortages for EEG technologists. Technologists at these centers were more likely 
to quarantine for suspected or confirmed COVID-19; OR 3.14 [1.01-9.63]; P = 
0.058.
CONCLUSIONS: There has been a widespread reduction in cEEG volume during the 
pandemic. Given the anticipated duration of the pandemic and the importance of 
cEEG in managing hospitalized patients,  to optimize use need to be 
prioritized to provide optimal care. Because the survey provides a 
cross-sectional assessment, follow-up studies can determine the long-term impact 
of the pandemic on cEEG utilization.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the absence of early epileptiform abnormalities 
predicts absence of later seizures on continuous EEG monitoring of hospitalized 
patients.
: We retrospectively reviewed 242 consecutive patients without a prior 
generalized convulsive seizure or active epilepsy who underwent continuous EEG 
monitoring lasting at least 18 hours for detection of nonconvulsive seizures or 
evaluation of unexplained altered mental status. The findings on the initial 
30-minute screening EEG, subsequent continuous EEG recordings, and baseline 
clinical data were analyzed. We identified early EEG findings associated with 
absence of seizures on subsequent continuous EEG.
RESULTS: Seizures were detected in 70 (29%) patients. A total of 52 patients had 
their first seizure in the initial 30 minutes of continuous EEG monitoring. Of 
the remaining 190 patients, 63 had epileptiform discharges on their initial EEG, 
24 had triphasic waves, while 103 had no epileptiform abnormalities. Seizures 
were later detected in 22% (n = 14) of studies with epileptiform discharges on 
their initial EEG, vs 3% (n = 3) of the studies without epileptiform 
abnormalities on initial EEG (p < 0.001). In the 3 patients without epileptiform 
abnormalities on initial EEG but with subsequent seizures, the first 
epileptiform discharge or electrographic seizure occurred within the first 4 
hours of recording.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients without epileptiform abnormalities during the first 4 
hours of recording, no seizures were subsequently detected. Therefore, EEG 
features early in the recording may indicate a low risk for seizures, and help 
determine whether extended monitoring is necessary.

BACKGROUND: To investigate the frequency, predictors, and clinical impact of 
electrographic seizures in patients with high clinical or radiologic grade 
non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), independent of referral bias.
: We compared rates of electrographic seizures and associated clinical 
variables and outcomes in patients with high clinical or radiologic grade 
non-traumatic SAH. Rates of electrographic seizure detection before and after 
institution of a guideline which made continuous EEG monitoring routine in this 
population were compared.
RESULTS: Electrographic seizures occurred in 17.6 % of patients monitored 
expressly because of clinically suspected subclinical seizures. In unselected 
patients, seizures still occurred in 9.6 % of all cases, and in 8.6 % of cases 
in which there was no a priori suspicion of seizures. The first seizure detected 
occurred 5.4 (IQR 2.9-7.3) days after onset of subarachnoid hemorrhage with 
three of eight patients (37.5 %) having the first recorded seizure more than 
48 h following EEG initiation, and 2/8 (25 %) at more than 72 h following EEG 
initiation. High clinical grade was associated with poor outcome at time of 
hospital discharge; electrographic seizures were not associated with poor 
outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Electrographic seizures occur at a relatively high rate in patients 
with non-traumatic SAH even after accounting for referral bias. The prolonged 
time to the first detected seizure in this cohort may reflect dynamic clinical 
features unique to the SAH population.

We sought to investigate electroencephalographers' real-world behaviors and 
opinions concerning reading routine EEG (rEEG) with or without clinical 
information. An eight-question, anonymous, online survey targeted at 
electroencephalographers was disseminated on social media from the s' 
personal accounts and emailed to s' select colleagues. A total of 389 
responses were included. Most respondents reported examining clinical 
information before describing rEEG findings. Nonetheless, only a minority of 
respondents believe that EEG analysis/description should be influenced by 
clinical information. We recommend reviewing clinical data only after an 
unbiased EEG read to prevent history bias and ensure generation of reliable 
electrodiagnostic information.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate whole-brain microinfarct burden from microinfarct counts 
in routine postmortem examination.
: We developed a simple mathematical method to estimate the total number 
of cerebral microinfarcts from counts obtained in the small amount of tissue 
routinely examined in brain autopsies. We derived estimates of total 
microinfarct burden from autopsy brain specimens from 648 older participants in 
2 community-based clinical-pathologic cohort studies of aging and dementia.
RESULTS: Our results indicate that observing 1 or 2 microinfarcts in 9 routine 
neuropathologic specimens implies a maximum-likelihood estimate of 552 or 1,104 
microinfarcts throughout the brain. Similar estimates were obtained when 
validating in larger sampled brain volumes.
CONCLUSIONS: The substantial whole-brain burden of cerebral microinfarcts 
suggested by even a few microinfarcts on routine pathologic sampling suggests a 
potential mechanism by which these lesions could cause neurologic dysfunction in 
individuals with small-vessel disease. The estimation framework developed here 
may generalize to clinicopathologic correlations of other imaging-negative 
micropathologies.

BACKGROUND: The neural mechanisms of anesthetic vapors have not been studied in 
depth. However, modeling and experimental studies on the intravenous anesthetic 
propofol indicate that potentiation of γ-aminobutyric acid receptors leads to a 
state of thalamocortical synchrony, observed as coherent frontal alpha 
oscillations, associated with unconsciousness. Sevoflurane, an ether derivative, 
also potentiates γ-aminobutyric acid receptors. However, in humans, 
sevoflurane-induced coherent frontal alpha oscillations have not been well 
detailed.
: To study the electroencephalogram dynamics induced by sevoflurane, the 
s identified age- and sex-matched patients in which sevoflurane (n = 30) 
or propofol (n = 30) was used as the sole agent for maintenance of general 
anesthesia during routine surgery. The s compared the electroencephalogram 
signatures of sevoflurane with that of propofol using time-varying spectral and 
coherence .
RESULTS: Sevoflurane general anesthesia is characterized by alpha oscillations 
with maximum power and coherence at approximately 10 Hz, (mean ± SD; peak power, 
4.3 ± 3.5 dB; peak coherence, 0.73 ± 0.1). These alpha oscillations are similar 
to those observed during propofol general anesthesia, which also has maximum 
power and coherence at approximately 10 Hz (peak power, 2.1 ± 4.3 dB; peak 
coherence, 0.71 ± 0.1). However, sevoflurane also exhibited a distinct theta 
coherence signature (peak frequency, 4.9 ± 0.6 Hz; peak coherence, 0.58 ± 0.1). 
Slow oscillations were observed in both cases, with no significant difference in 
power or coherence.
CONCLUSIONS: The study results indicate that sevoflurane, like propofol, induces 
coherent frontal alpha oscillations and slow oscillations in humans to sustain 
the anesthesia-induced unconscious state. These results suggest a shared 
molecular and systems-level mechanism for the unconscious state induced by these 
drugs.

OBJECTIVE: The presence of interictal epileptiform discharges (IED) in the 
electroencephalogram (EEG) is a key finding in the medical workup of a patient 
with suspected epilepsy. However, inter-rater agreement (IRA) regarding the 
presence of IED is imperfect, leading to incorrect and delayed diagnoses. An 
improved understanding of which IED attributes mediate expert IRA might help in 
developing automatic  for IED detection able to emulate the abilities of 
experts. Therefore, using a set of IED scored by a large number of experts, we 
set out to determine which attributes of IED predict expert agreement regarding 
the presence of IED.
: IED were annotated on a 5-point scale by 18 clinical neurophysiologists 
within 200 30-s EEG segments from recordings of 200 patients. 5538 signal 
analysis features were extracted from the waveforms, including wavelet 
coefficients, morphological features, signal energy, nonlinear energy operator 
response, electrode location, and spectrogram features. Feature selection was 
performed by applying elastic net regression and support vector regression (SVR) 
was applied to predict expert opinion, with and without the feature selection 
procedure and with and without several types of signal normalization.
RESULTS: Multiple types of features were useful for predicting expert 
annotations, but particular types of wavelet features performed best. Local EEG 
normalization also enhanced best model performance. As the size of the group of 
EEGers used to train the models was increased, the performance of the models 
leveled off at a group size of around 11.
CONCLUSIONS: The features that best predict inter-rater agreement among experts 
regarding the presence of IED are wavelet features, using locally standardized 
EEG. Our models for predicting expert opinion based on EEGer's scores perform 
best with a large group of EEGers (more than 10).
SIGNIFICANCE: By examining a large group of EEG signal analysis features we 
found that wavelet features with certain wavelet basis functions performed best 
to identify IEDs. Local normalization also improves predictability, suggesting 
the importance of IED morphology over amplitude-based features. Although most 
IED detection studies in the past have used opinion from three or fewer experts, 
our study suggests a "wisdom of the crowd" effect, such that pooling over a 
larger number of expert opinions produces a better correlation between expert 
opinion and objectively quantifiable features of the EEG.

Over- and under-sedation are common in the ICU, and contribute to poor ICU 
outcomes including delirium. Behavioral assessments, such as Richmond 
Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) for monitoring levels of sedation and Confusion 
Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) for detecting signs of delirium, are 
often used. As an alternative, brain monitoring with electroencephalography 
(EEG) has been proposed in the operating room, but is challenging to implement 
in ICU due to the differences between critical illness and elective surgery, as 
well as the duration of sedation. Here we present a deep learning model based on 
a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks that automatically 
tracks both the level of consciousness and delirium using frontal EEG signals in 
the ICU. For level of consciousness, the system achieves a median accuracy of 
70% when allowing prediction to be within one RASS level difference across all 
patients, which is comparable or higher than the median technician-nurse 
agreement at 59%. For delirium, the system achieves an AUC of 0.80 with 69% 
sensitivity and 83% specificity at the optimal operating point. The results show 
it is feasible to continuously track level of consciousness and delirium in the 
ICU.

IMPORTANCE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory illness 
with a high rate of hospitalization and mortality. Biomarkers are urgently 
needed for patient risk stratification. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), 
a component of complete blood counts that reflects cellular volume variation, 
has been shown to be associated with elevated risk for morbidity and mortality 
in a wide range of diseases.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether an association between mortality risk and 
elevated RDW at hospital admission and during hospitalization exists in patients 
with COVID-19.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study included adults diagnosed 
with SARS-CoV-2 infection and admitted to 1 of 4 hospitals in the Boston, 
Massachusetts area (Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women's 
Hospital, North Shore Medical Center, and Newton-Wellesley Hospital) between 
March 4, 2020, and April 28, 2020.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was patient survival during 
hospitalization. Measures included RDW at admission and during hospitalization, 
with an elevated RDW defined as greater than 14.5%. Relative risk (RR) of 
mortality was estimated by dividing the mortality of those with an elevated RDW 
by the mortality of those without an elevated RDW. Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) 
and 95% CIs were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: A total of 1641 patients were included in the study (mean [SD] age, 
62[18] years; 886 men [54%]; 740 White individuals [45%] and 497 Hispanic 
individuals [30%]; 276 nonsurvivors [17%]). Elevated RDW (>14.5%) was associated 
with an increased mortality risk in patients of all ages. The RR for the entire 
cohort was 2.73, with a mortality rate of 11% in patients with normal RDW (1173) 
and 31% in those with an elevated RDW (468). The RR in patients younger than 50 
years was 5.25 (normal RDW, 1% [n = 341]; elevated RDW, 8% [n = 65]); 2.90 in 
the 50- to 59-year age group (normal RDW, 8% [n = 256]; elevated RDW, 24% 
[n = 63]); 3.96 in the 60- to 69-year age group (normal RDW, 8% [n = 226]; 
elevated RDW, 30% [104]); 1.45 in the 70- to 79-year age group (normal RDW, 23% 
[n = 182]; elevated RDW, 33% [n = 113]); and 1.59 in those ≥80 years (normal 
RDW, 29% [n = 168]; elevated RDW, 46% [n = 123]). RDW was associated with 
mortality risk in Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, D-dimer 
(dimerized plasmin fragment D) level, absolute lymphocyte count, and common 
comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension (hazard ratio of 1.09 per 0.5% 
RDW increase and 2.01 for an RDW >14.5% vs ≤14.5%; P < .001). Patients whose RDW 
increased during hospitalization had higher mortality compared with those whose 
RDW did not change; for those with normal RDW, mortality increased from 6% to 
24%, and for those with an elevated RDW at admission, mortality increased from 
22% to 40%.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Elevated RDW at the time of hospital admission and an 
increase in RDW during hospitalization were associated with increased mortality 
risk for patients with COVID-19 who received treatment at 4 hospitals in a large 
academic medical center network.

OBJECTIVE: Deep hypothermia induces 'burst suppression' (BS), an 
electroencephalogram pattern with low-voltage 'suppressions' alternating with 
high-voltage 'bursts'. Current understanding of BS comes mainly from anesthesia 
studies, while hypothermia-induced BS has received little study. We set out to 
investigate the electroencephalogram changes induced by cooling the human brain 
through increasing depths of BS through isoelectricity.
: We recorded scalp electroencephalograms from eleven patients undergoing 
deep hypothermia during cardiac surgery with complete circulatory arrest, and 
analyzed these using  of spectral analysis.
RESULTS: Within patients, the depth of BS systematically depends on the depth of 
hypothermia, though responses vary between patients except at temperature 
extremes. With decreasing temperature, burst lengths increase, and burst 
amplitudes and lengths decrease, while the spectral content of bursts remains 
constant.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support an existing theoretical model in which the 
common mechanism of burst suppression across diverse etiologies is the cyclical 
diffuse depletion of metabolic resources, and suggest the new hypothesis of 
local micro-network dropout to explain decreasing burst amplitudes at lower 
temperatures.
SIGNIFICANCE: These results pave the way for accurate noninvasive tracking of 
brain metabolic state during surgical procedures under deep hypothermia, and 
suggest new testable predictions about the network mechanisms underlying burst 
suppression.

Automated annotation of electroencephalograms (EEG) of epileptic patients is 
important in diagnosis and management of epilepsy. Epilepsy is often associated 
with the presence of epileptiform transients (ET) in the EEG. To develop an 
efficient ET detector, a vast amount of data is required to train and evaluate 
the performance of the detector. Interictal EEG data contains mostly background 
waveforms, since ETs only occur occasionally in most patients. In order to 
detect ETs in an automated fashion, it is meaningful to first try to eliminate 
most background waveforms by means of simple, fast classifiers. The remaining 
waveforms can in a following step be processed by more sophisticated and 
computationally demanding classification algorithms, such as deep learning 
systems. In this study, we design a cascade of simple thresholding steps to 
reject most background waveforms in interictal EEG, while maintaining most ETs. 
Several simple and quick-to-compute EEG features are chosen. By thresholding 
these features in consecutive steps, background waveforms are rejected 
sequentially. In our numerical experiments, a cascade of 10 steps is able to 
reject 98.65% of all background segments in the dataset, while preserving 90.6% 
of the ETs.

BACKGROUND: Generalized triphasic waves (TPWs) occur in both metabolic 
encephalopathies and non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). Empiric trials of 
benzodiazepines (BZDs) or non-sedating AED (NSAEDs) are commonly used to 
differentiate the two, but the utility of such trials is debated. The goal of 
this study was to assess response rates of such trials and investigate whether 
metabolic profile differences affect the likelihood of a response.
: Three institutions within the Critical Care EEG Monitoring Research 
Consortium retrospectively identified patients with unexplained encephalopathy 
and TPWs who had undergone a trial of BZD and/or NSAEDs to differentiate between 
ictal and non-ictal patterns. We assessed responder rates and compared metabolic 
profiles of responders and non-responders. Response was defined as resolution of 
the EEG pattern and either unequivocal improvement in encephalopathy or 
appearance of previously absent normal EEG patterns, and further categorized as 
immediate (within <2 h of trial initiation) or delayed (>2 h from trial 
initiation).
RESULTS: We identified 64 patients with TPWs who had an empiric trial of BZD 
and/or NSAED. Most patients (71.9%) were admitted with metabolic derangements 
and/or infection. Positive clinical responses occurred in 10/53 (18.9%) treated 
with BZDs. Responses to NSAEDs occurred in 19/45 (42.2%), being immediate in 
6.7%, delayed but definite in 20.0%, and delayed but equivocal in 15.6%. 
Overall, 22/64 (34.4%) showed a definite response to either BZDs or NSAEDs, and 
7/64 (10.9%) showed a possible response. Metabolic differences of responders 
versus non-responders were statistically insignificant, except that the 48-h low 
value of albumin in the BZD responder group was lower than in the non-responder 
group.
CONCLUSIONS: Similar metabolic profiles in patients with encephalopathy and TPWs 
between responders and non-responders to anticonvulsants suggest that predicting 
responders a priori is difficult. The high responder rate suggests that empiric 
trials of anticonvulsants indeed provide useful clinical information. The more 
than twofold higher response rate to NSAEDs suggests that this strategy may be 
preferable to BZDs. Further prospective investigation is warranted.

Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.

Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is an increasingly 
recognized acute cerebrovascular condition that may produce myriad transient and 
sustained neurologic deficits as well as a host of radiologic features. We 
report the case of a woman with RCVS and a severe clinical syndrome with 
bilateral basal ganglia hemorrhages, cerebral infarctions, and marked vascular 
abnormalities. The patient made a near complete clinical recovery, representing 
an extreme and illustrative form of RCVS.

BACKGROUND: In critical care settings, electroencephalography (EEG) with reduced 
number of electrodes (reduced montage EEG, rm-EEG) might be a timely alternative 
to the conventional full montage EEG (fm-EEG). However, past studies have 
reported variable accuracies for detecting seizures using rm-EEG. We 
hypothesized that the past studies did not distinguish between differences in 
sensitivity from differences in classification of EEG patterns by different 
readers. The goal of the present study was to revisit the diagnostic value of 
rm-EEG when confounding issues are accounted for.
: We retrospectively collected 212 adult EEGs recorded at Massachusetts 
General Hospital and reviewed by two epileptologists with access to clinical, 
trending, and video information. In Phase I of the study, we re-configured the 
first 4 h of the EEGs in lateral circumferential montage with ten electrodes and 
asked new readers to interpret the EEGs without access to any other ancillary 
information. We compared their rating to the reading of hospital clinicians with 
access to ancillary information. In Phase II, we measured the accuracy of the 
same raters reading representative samples of the discordant EEGs in full and 
reduced configurations presented randomly by comparing their performance to 
majority consensus as the gold standard.
RESULTS: Of the 95 EEGs without seizures in the selected fm-EEG, readers of 
rm-EEG identified 92 cases (97%) as having no seizure activity. Of 117 EEGs with 
"seizures" identified in the selected fm-EEG, none of the cases was labeled as 
normal on rm-EEG. Readers of rm-EEG reported pathological activity in 100% of 
cases, but labeled them as seizures (N = 77), rhythmic or periodic patterns 
(N = 24), epileptiform spikes (N = 7), or burst suppression (N = 6). When the 
same raters read representative epochs of the discordant EEG cases (N = 43) in 
both fm-EEG and rm-EEG configurations, we found high concordance (95%) and 
intra-rater agreement (93%) between fm-EEG and rm-EEG diagnoses.
CONCLUSIONS: Reduced EEG with ten electrodes in circumferential configuration 
preserves key features of the traditional EEG system. Discrepancies between 
rm-EEG and fm-EEG as reported in some of the past studies can be in part due to 
methodological factors such as choice of gold standard diagnosis, asymmetric 
access to ancillary clinical information, and inter-rater variability rather 
than detection failure of rm-EEG as a result of electrode reduction per se.

Continuous EEG.

BACKGROUND: Ictal-interictal continuum (IIC) continuous EEG (cEEG) patterns 
including periodic discharges and rhythmic delta activity are associated with 
poor outcome and in the appropriate clinical context, IIC patterns may represent 
"electroclinical" status epilepticus (SE). To clarify the significance of IIC 
patterns and their relationship to "electrographic" SE, we investigated FDG-PET 
imaging as a complementary metabolic biomarker of SE among patients with IIC 
patterns.
: A single-center prospective clinical database was ascertained for 
patients undergoing FDG-PET during cEEG. Following MRI-PET co-registration, the 
maximum standardized uptake value in cortical and subcortical regions was 
compared to contralateral homologous and cerebellar regions. Consensus cEEG 
review and clinical rating of etiology and treatment response were performed 
retrospectively with blinding. Electrographic SE was classified as discrete 
seizures without interictal recovery or >3-Hz rhythmic IIC patterns. 
Electroclinical SE was classified as IIC patterns with electrographic and 
clinical response to anticonvulsants; clonic activity; or persistent post-ictal 
encephalopathy.
RESULTS: Eighteen hospitalized subjects underwent FDG-PET during contemporaneous 
IIC patterns attributed to structural lesions (44 %), 
neuroinflammatory/neuroinfectious disease (39 %), or epilepsy (11 %). FDG-PET 
hypermetabolism was common (61 %) and predicted electrographic or 
electroclinical SE (sensitivity 79 % [95 % CI 53-93 %] and specificity 100 % 
[95 % CI 51-100 %]; p = 0.01). Excluding electrographic SE, hypermetabolism also 
predicted electroclinical SE (sensitivity 80 % [95 % CI 44-94 %] and specificity 
100 % [95 % CI 51-100 %]; p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized patients with IIC EEG patterns, FDG-PET 
hypermetabolism is common and is a candidate metabolic biomarker of 
electrographic SE or electroclinical SE.

OBJECTIVE: To address the question: does non-convulsive status epilepticus 
warrant the same aggressive treatment as convulsive status epilepticus?
: We used a decision model to evaluate the risks and benefits of treating 
non-convulsive status epilepticus with intravenous anesthetics and ICU-level 
aggressive care. We investigated how the decision to use aggressive versus 
non-aggressive management for non-convulsive status epilepticus impacts expected 
patient outcome for four etiologies: absence epilepsy, discontinued 
antiepileptic drugs, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and hypoxic ischemic 
encephalopathy. Each etiology was defined by distinct values for five key 
parameters: baseline mortality rate of the inciting etiology; efficacy of 
non-aggressive treatment in gaining control of seizures; the relative 
contribution of seizures to overall mortality; the degree of excess disability 
expected in the case of delayed seizure control; and the mortality risk of 
aggressive treatment.
RESULTS: Non-aggressive treatment was favored for etiologies with low morbidity 
and mortality such as absence epilepsy and discontinued antiepileptic drugs. The 
risk of aggressive treatment was only warranted in etiologies where there was 
significant risk of seizure-induced neurologic damage. In the case of 
post-anoxic status epilepticus, expected outcomes were poor regardless of the 
treatment chosen. The favored strategy in each case was determined by strong 
interactions of all five model parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Determination of the optimal management approach to non-convulsive 
status epilepticus is complex and is ultimately determined by the inciting 
etiology.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a personalizable algorithm to discriminate between 
sedation levels in ICU patients based on heart rate variability.
DESIGN: Multicenter, pilot study.
SETTING: Several ICUs at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.
PATIENTS: We gathered 21,912 hours of routine electrocardiogram recordings from 
a heterogenous group of 70 adult ICU patients. All patients included in the 
study were mechanically ventilated and were receiving sedatives.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: As "ground truth" for developing our method, we 
used Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale scores grouped into four levels denoted 
"comatose" (-5), "deeply sedated" (-4 to -3), "lightly sedated" (-2 to 0), and 
"agitated" (+1 to +4). We trained a support vector machine learning algorithm to 
calculate the probability of each sedation level from heart rate variability 
measures derived from the electrocardiogram. To estimate algorithm performance, 
we calculated leave-one-subject out cross-validated accuracy. The 
patient-independent version of the proposed system discriminated between the 
four sedation levels with an overall accuracy of 59%. Upon personalizing the 
system supplementing the training data with patient-specific calibration data, 
consisting of an individual's labeled heart rate variability epochs from the 
preceding 24 hours, accuracy improved to 67%. The personalized system 
discriminated between light- and deep-sedation states with an average accuracy 
of 75%.
CONCLUSIONS: With further refinement, the methodology reported herein could lead 
to a fully automated system for depth of sedation monitoring. By enabling 
monitoring to be continuous, such technology may help clinical staff to monitor 
sedation levels more effectively and to reduce complications related to over- 
and under sedation.

Much recent work in systems neuroscience has focused on how dynamic interactions 
between different cortical regions underlie complex brain functions such as 
motor coordination, language and emotional regulation. Various studies using 
neuroimaging and neurophysiologic techniques have suggested that in many 
neuropsychiatric disorders, these dynamic brain networks are dysregulated. Here 
we review the utility of combined noninvasive brain stimulation and neuroimaging 
approaches towards greater understanding of dynamic brain networks in health and 
disease. Brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation 
and transcranial direct current stimulation, use electromagnetic principles to 
alter brain activity noninvasively, and induce focal but also network effects 
beyond the stimulation site. When combined with brain imaging techniques such as 
functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography and 
electroencephalography, these brain stimulation techniques enable a causal 
assessment of the interaction between different network components, and their 
respective functional roles. The same techniques can also be applied to explore 
hypotheses regarding the changes in functional connectivity that occur during 
task performance and in various disease states such as stroke, depression and 
schizophrenia. Finally, in diseases characterized by pathologic alterations in 
either the excitability within a single region or in the activity of distributed 
networks, such techniques provide a potential mechanism to alter cortical 
network function and architectures in a beneficial manner.

The EEG of epileptic patients often contains sharp waveforms called "spikes", 
occurring between seizures. Detecting such spikes is crucial for diagnosing 
epilepsy. In this paper, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) for 
detecting spikes in EEG of epileptic patients in an automated fashion. The CNN 
has a convolutional architecture with filters of various sizes applied to the 
input layer, leaky ReLUs as activation functions, and a sigmoid output layer. 
Balanced mini-batches were applied to handle the imbalance in the data set. 
Leave-one-patient-out cross-validation was carried out to test the CNN and 
benchmark models on EEG data of five epilepsy patients. We achieved 0.947 AUC 
for the CNN, while the best performing benchmark model, Support Vector Machines 
with Gaussian kernel, achieved an AUC of 0.912.

CLUSTERING OF INTERICTAL SPIKES BY DYNAMIC TIME WARPING AND AFFINITY 
PROPAGATION.

Epilepsy is often associated with the presence of spikes in 
electroencephalograms (EEGs). The spike waveforms vary vastly among epilepsy 
patients, and also for the same patient across time. In order to develop 
semi-automated and automated  for detecting spikes, it is crucial to 
obtain a better understanding of the various spike shapes. In this paper, we 
develop several approaches to extract exemplars of spikes. We generate spike 
exemplars by applying clustering algorithms to a database of spikes from 12 
patients. As similarity measures for clustering, we consider the Euclidean 
distance and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). We assess two clustering algorithms, 
namely, K-means clustering and affinity propagation. The clustering  are 
compared based on the mean squared error, and the similarity measures are 
assessed based on the number of generated spike clusters. Affinity propagation 
with DTW is shown to be the best combination for clustering epileptic spikes, 
since it generates fewer spike templates and does not require to pre-specify the 
number of spike templates.

IMPORTANCE: Epileptiform electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns are common after 
resuscitation from cardiac arrest, are associated with patient outcome, and may 
require treatment. It is unknown whether continuous EEG monitoring is needed to 
detect these patterns or if brief intermittent monitoring is sufficient. If 
continuous monitoring is required, the necessary duration of observation is 
unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To quantify the time-dependent sensitivity of continuous EEG for 
epileptiform event detection, and to compare continuous EEG to several 
alternative EEG-monitoring strategies for post-cardiac arrest outcome 
prediction.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This observational cohort study was conducted 
in 2 academic medical centers between September 2010 and January 2018. 
Participants included 759 adults who were comatose after being resuscitated from 
cardiac arrest and who underwent 24 hours or more of EEG monitoring.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Epileptiform EEG patterns associated with 
neurological outcome at hospital discharge, such as seizures likely to cause 
secondary injury.
RESULTS: Overall, 759 patients were included in the analysis; 281 (37.0%) were 
female, and the mean (SD) age was 58 (17) years. Epileptiform EEG activity was 
observed in 414 participants (54.5%), of whom only 26 (3.4%) developed 
potentially treatable seizures. Brief intermittent EEG had an estimated 66% (95% 
CI, 62%-69%) to 68% (95% CI, 66%-70%) sensitivity for detection of prognostic 
epileptiform events. Depending on initial continuity of the EEG background, 0 to 
51 hours of monitoring were needed to achieve 95% sensitivity for the detection 
of prognostic epileptiform events. Brief intermittent EEG had a sensitivity of 
7% (95% CI, 4%-12%) to 8% (95% CI, 4%-12%) for the detection of potentially 
treatable seizures, and 0 to 53 hours of continuous monitoring were needed to 
achieve 95% sensitivity for the detection of potentially treatable seizures. 
Brief intermittent EEG results yielded similar information compared with 
continuous EEG results when added to multivariable models predicting 
neurological outcome.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Compared with continuous EEG monitoring, brief 
intermittent monitoring was insensitive for detection of epileptiform events. 
Monitoring EEG results significantly improved multimodality prediction of 
neurological outcome, but continuous monitoring appeared to add little 
additional information compared with brief intermittent monitoring.

Cerebral infarction due to smoker's polycythemia.

Thakur KT, Westover MB.

 information:
Massachusetts General Hospital, Department of Neurology, Boston, 
Massachusetts, United States.

A 65-year-old man presented with fluctuating focal neurological deficits and 
neuroimaging findings of multiple small cerebral infarctions. His medical 
investigation revealed a >100 pack/year smoking history, and a haematocrit >60. 
Subsequent investigations led to a diagnosis of cerebral infarction due to 
smoker's polycythemia, the third such case reported in the medical literature. 
The patient's neurological deficits resolved completely with subsequent 
haematocrit reduction. This brief report reviews the differential diagnosis of 
polycythemia, current knowledge of the mechanisms by which smoker's polycythemia 
may lead to ischemic stroke, and recommendations for management.

Significance testing as perverse probabilistic reasoning.

Westover MB, Westover KD, Bianchi MT.

 information:
Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical 
School, Boston, MA, USA. mwestover@partners.org

Truth claims in the medical literature rely heavily on statistical significance 
testing. Unfortunately, most physicians misunderstand the underlying 
probabilistic logic of significance tests and consequently often misinterpret 
their results. This near-universal misunderstanding is highlighted by means of a 
simple quiz which we administered to 246 physicians at two major academic 
hospitals, on which the proportion of incorrect responses exceeded 90%. A solid 
understanding of the fundamental concepts of probability theory is becoming 
essential to the rational interpretation of medical information. This essay 
provides a technically sound review of these concepts that is accessible to a 
medical audience. We also briefly review the debate in the cognitive sciences 
regarding physicians' aptitude for probabilistic inference.

Statin use following intracerebral hemorrhage: a decision analysis.

Massachusetts General Hospital Stroke Research Center, 175 Cambridge Street, 
Boston, MA 02114, USA.

Comment in
    Arch Neurol. 2011 May;68(5):565-6.

CONTEXT: Statins are widely prescribed for primary and secondary prevention of 
ischemic cardiac and cerebrovascular disease. Although serious adverse effects 
are uncommon, results from a recent clinical trial suggested increased risk of 
intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) associated with statin use. For patients with 
baseline elevated risk of ICH, it is not known whether this potential adverse 
effect offsets the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular benefits.
OBJECTIVE: To address the following clinical question: Given a history of prior 
ICH, should statin therapy be avoided?
DESIGN: A Markov decision model was used to evaluate the risks and benefits of 
statin therapy in patients with prior ICH.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Life expectancy, measured as quality-adjusted life-years. 
We investigated how statin use affects this outcome measure while varying a 
range of clinical parameters, including hemorrhage location (deep vs lobar), 
ischemic cardiac and cerebrovascular risks, and magnitude of ICH risk associated 
with statins.
RESULTS: Avoiding statins was favored over a wide range of values for many 
clinical parameters, particularly in survivors of lobar ICH who are at highest 
risk of ICH recurrence. In survivors of lobar ICH without prior cardiovascular 
events, avoiding statins yielded a life expectancy gain of 2.2 quality-adjusted 
life-years compared with statin use. This net benefit persisted even at the 
lower 95% confidence interval of the relative risk of statin-associated ICH. In 
patients with lobar ICH who had prior cardiovascular events, the annual 
recurrence risk of myocardial infarction would have to exceed 90% to favor 
statin therapy. Avoiding statin therapy was also favored, although by a smaller 
margin, in both primary and secondary prevention settings for survivors of deep 
ICH.
CONCLUSIONS: Avoiding statins should be considered for patients with a history 
of ICH, particularly those cases with a lobar location.

New Haven, Connecticut, U.S.A.; and §Department of Neurology, Massachusetts 
General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.A.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate automated implementations of continuous 
EEG monitoring-based detection of delayed cerebral ischemia based on  
used in classical retrospective studies. We studied 95 patients with either 
Fisher 3 or Hunt Hess 4 to 5 aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage who were 
admitted to the Neurosciences ICU and underwent continuous EEG monitoring. We 
implemented several variations of two classical algorithms for automated 
detection of delayed cerebral ischemia based on decreases in alpha-delta ratio 
and relative alpha variability. Of 95 patients, 43 (45%) developed delayed 
cerebral ischemia. Our automated implementation of the classical alpha-delta 
ratio-based trending method resulted in a sensitivity and specificity (Se,Sp) of 
(80,27)%, compared with the values of (100,76)% reported in the classic study 
using similar  in a nonautomated fashion. Our automated implementation of 
the classical relative alpha variability-based trending method yielded (Se,Sp) 
values of (65,43)%, compared with (100,46)% reported in the classic study using 
nonautomated analysis. Our findings suggest that improved  to detect 
decreases in alpha-delta ratio and relative alpha variability are needed before 
an automated EEG-based early delayed cerebral ischemia detection system is ready 
for clinical use.

Spreading depolarizations (SD) are waves of abrupt, near-complete breakdown of 
neuronal transmembrane ion gradients, are the largest possible pathophysiologic 
disruption of viable cerebral gray matter, and are a crucial mechanism of lesion 
development. Spreading depolarizations are increasingly recorded during 
multimodal neuromonitoring in neurocritical care as a causal biomarker providing 
a diagnostic summary measure of metabolic failure and excitotoxic injury. Focal 
ischemia causes spreading depolarization within minutes. Further spreading 
depolarizations arise for hours to days due to energy supply-demand mismatch in 
viable tissue. Spreading depolarizations exacerbate neuronal injury through 
prolonged ionic breakdown and spreading depolarization-related hypoperfusion 
(spreading ischemia). Local duration of the depolarization indicates local 
tissue energy status and risk of injury. Regional electrocorticographic 
monitoring affords even remote detection of injury because spreading 
depolarizations propagate widely from ischemic or metabolically stressed zones; 
characteristic patterns, including temporal clusters of spreading 
depolarizations and persistent depression of spontaneous cortical activity, can 
be recognized and quantified. Here, we describe the experimental basis for 
interpreting these patterns and illustrate their translation to human disease. 
We further provide consensus recommendations for electrocorticographic  
to record, classify, and score spreading depolarizations and associated 
spreading depressions. These  offer distinct advantages over other 
neuromonitoring modalities and allow for future refinement through less invasive 
and more automated approaches.

A modern understanding of how cerebral cortical lesions develop after acute 
brain injury is based on Aristides Leão's historic discoveries of spreading 
depression and asphyxial/anoxic depolarization. Treated as separate entities for 
decades, we now appreciate that these events define a continuum of spreading 
mass depolarizations, a concept that is central to understanding their 
pathologic effects. Within minutes of acute severe ischemia, the onset of 
persistent depolarization triggers the breakdown of ion homeostasis and 
development of cytotoxic edema. These persistent changes are diagnosed as 
diffusion restriction in magnetic resonance imaging and define the ischemic 
core. In delayed lesion growth, transient spreading depolarizations arise 
spontaneously in the ischemic penumbra and induce further persistent 
depolarization and excitotoxic damage, progressively expanding the ischemic 
core. The causal role of these waves in lesion development has been proven by 
real-time monitoring of electrophysiology, blood flow, and cytotoxic edema. The 
spreading depolarization continuum further applies to other models of acute 
cortical lesions, suggesting that it is a universal principle of cortical lesion 
development. These pathophysiologic concepts establish a working hypothesis for 
translation to human disease, where complex patterns of depolarizations are 
observed in acute brain injury and appear to mediate and signal ongoing 
secondary damage.

Biological and machine pattern recognition systems face a common challenge: 
Given sensory data about an unknown pattern, classify the pattern by searching 
for the best match within a library of representations stored in memory. In many 
cases, the number of patterns to be discriminated and the richness of the raw 
data force recognition systems to internally represent memory and sensory 
information in a compressed format. However, these representations must preserve 
enough information to accommodate the variability and complexity of the 
environment, otherwise recognition will be unreliable. Thus, there is an 
intrinsic tradeoff between the amount of resources devoted to data 
representation and the complexity of the environment in which a recognition 
system may reliably operate. In this paper, we describe a mathematical model for 
pattern recognition systems subject to resource constraints, and show how the 
aforementioned resource-complexity tradeoff can be characterized in terms of 
three rates related to the number of bits available for representing memory and 
sensory data, and the number of patterns populating a given statistical 
environment. We prove single-letter information-theoretic bounds governing the 
achievable rates, and investigate in detail two illustrative cases where the 
pattern data is either binary or Gaussian.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the prognostic ability of the combination of EEG and MRI 
in identifying patients with good outcome in postanoxic myoclonus (PAM) after 
cardiac arrest (CA).
: Adults with PAM who had an MRI within 20 days after CA were identified 
in 4 prospective CA registries. The primary outcome measure was coma recovery to 
command following by hospital discharge. Clinical examination included brainstem 
reflexes and motor activity. EEG was assessed for best background continuity, 
reactivity, presence of epileptiform activity, and burst suppression with 
identical bursts (BSIB). MRI was examined for presence of diffusion restriction 
or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery changes consistent with anoxic brain 
injury. A prediction model was developed using optimal combination of variables.
RESULTS: Among 78 patients, 11 (14.1%) recovered at discharge and 6 (7.7%) had 
good outcome (Cerebral Performance Category < 3) at 3 months. Patients who 
followed commands were more likely to have pupillary and corneal reflexes, 
flexion or better motor response, EEG continuity and reactivity, no BSIB, and no 
anoxic injury on MRI. The combined EEG/MRI variable of continuous background and 
no anoxic changes on MRI was associated with coma recovery at hospital discharge 
with sensitivity 91% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-1.00), specificity 99% 
(95% CI, 0.92-1.00), positive predictive value 91% (95% CI, 0.59-1.00), and 
negative predictive value 99% (95% CI, 0.92-1.00).
CONCLUSIONS: EEG and MRI are complementary and identify both good and poor 
outcome in patients with PAM with high accuracy. An MRI should be considered in 
patients with myoclonus showing continuous or reactive EEGs.

In this review, we discuss the utility of quantitative EEG parameters for the 
detection of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) after aneurysmal subarachnoid 
hemorrhage in the context of the complex pathophysiology of DCI and the 
limitations of current diagnostic . Because of the multifactorial 
pathophysiology of DCI, methodologies solely assessing blood vessel narrowing 
(vasospasm) are insufficient to detect all DCI. Quantitative EEG has facilitated 
the exploration of EEG as a diagnostic modality of DCI. Multiple quantitative 
EEG parameters such as alpha power, relative alpha variability, and alpha/delta 
ratio show reliable detection of DCI in multiple studies. Recent studies on 
epileptiform abnormalities suggest that their potential for the detection of 
DCI. Quantitative EEG is a promising, continuous, noninvasive, monitoring 
modality of DCI implementable in daily practice. Future work should validate 
these parameters in larger populations, facilitated by the development of 
automated detection algorithms and multimodal data integration.

BACKGROUND: General anaesthesia induces highly structured oscillations in the 
electroencephalogram (EEG) in adults, but the anaesthesia-induced EEG in 
paediatric patients is less understood. Neural circuits undergo structural and 
functional transformations during development that might be reflected in 
anaesthesia-induced EEG oscillations. We therefore investigated age-related 
changes in the EEG during sevoflurane general anaesthesia in paediatric 
patients.
: We analysed the EEG recorded during routine care of patients between 0 
and 28 yr of age (n=54), using power spectral and coherence . The power 
spectrum quantifies the energy in the EEG at each frequency, while the coherence 
measures the frequency-dependent correlation or synchronization between EEG 
signals at different scalp locations. We characterized the EEG as a function of 
age and within 5 age groups: <1 yr old (n=4), 1-6 yr old (n=12), >6-14 yr old 
(n=14), >14-21 yr old (n=11), >21-28 yr old (n=13).
RESULTS: EEG power significantly increased from infancy through ∼6 yr, 
subsequently declining to a plateau at approximately 21 yr. Alpha (8-13 Hz) 
coherence, a prominent EEG feature associated with sevoflurane-induced 
unconsciousness in adults, is absent in patients <1 yr.
CONCLUSIONS: Sevoflurane-induced EEG dynamics in children vary significantly as 
a function of age. These age-related dynamics likely reflect ongoing development 
within brain circuits that are modulated by sevoflurane. These readily observed 
paediatric-specific EEG signatures could be used to improve brain state 
monitoring in children receiving general anaesthesia.

point estimates of the pretest probability and the likelihood ratio 
corresponding to the test result; however, it may be more appropriate in 
clinical situations to consider instead a range of possible values to express 
uncertainty in the estimates of these parameters. We thus sought to demonstrate 
how uncertainty in sensitivity, specificity, and disease pretest probability can 
be accommodated in Bayesian interpretation of diagnostic testing.
: We investigated three questions: How does uncertainty in the likelihood 
ratio propagate to the posttest probability range, assuming a point estimate of 
pretest probability? How does uncertainty in the sensitivity and specificity of 
a test affect uncertainty in the likelihood ratio? How does uncertainty 
propagate when present in both the pretest probability and the likelihood ratio?
RESULTS: Propagation of likelihood ratio uncertainty depends on the pretest 
probability and is more prominent for unexpected test results. Uncertainty in 
sensitivity and specificity propagates into the calculation of likelihood ratio 
prominently as these parameters approach 100%; even modest errors of ± 10% 
caused dramatic propagation. Combining errors of ± 20% in the pretest 
probability and in the likelihood ratio exhibited modest propagation to posttest 
probability, suggesting a realistic target range for clinical estimations.
CONCLUSIONS: The results provide a framework for incorporating ranges of 
uncertainty into Bayesian reasoning. Although point estimates simplify the 
implementation of Bayesian reasoning, it is important to recognize the 
implications of error propagation when ranges are considered in this multistep 
process.

OBJECTIVE: To integrate long-term measures of disease-modifying drug efficacy 
and risk to guide selection of first-line treatment of multiple sclerosis.
: We created a Markov decision model to evaluate disability worsening and 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) risk in patients receiving 
natalizumab (NTZ), fingolimod (FGL), or glatiramer acetate (GA) over 30 years. 
Leveraging publicly available data, we integrated treatment utility, disability 
worsening, and risk of PML into quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). We 
performed sensitivity analyses varying PML risk, mortality and morbidity, and 
relative risk of disease worsening across clinically relevant ranges.
RESULTS: Over the entire reported range of NTZ-associated PML risk, NTZ as 
first-line therapy is predicted to provide a greater net benefit (15.06 QALYs) 
than FGL (13.99 QALYs) or GA (12.71 QALYs) treatment over 30 years, after 
accounting for loss of QALYs due to PML or death (resulting from all causes). 
NTZ treatment is associated with delayed worsening to an Expanded Disability 
Status Scale score ≥6.0 vs FGL or GA (22.7, 17.0, and 12.4 years, respectively). 
Compared to untreated patients, NTZ-treated patients have a greater relative 
risk of death in the early years of treatment that varies according to PML risk 
profile.
CONCLUSIONS: NTZ as a first-line treatment is associated with the highest net 
benefit across full ranges of PML risk, mortality, and morbidity compared to FGL 
or GA. Integrated modeling of long-term treatment risks and benefits informs 
stratified clinical decision-making and can support patient counseling on 
selection of first-line treatment options.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Automated sleep staging has been previously limited by a 
combination of clinical and physiological heterogeneity. Both factors are in 
principle addressable with large data sets that enable robust calibration. 
However, the impact of sample size remains uncertain. The objectives are to 
investigate the extent to which machine learning  can approximate the 
performance of human scorers when supplied with sufficient training cases and to 
investigate how staging performance depends on the number of training patients, 
contextual information, model complexity, and imbalance between sleep stage 
proportions.
: A total of 102 features were extracted from six electroencephalography 
(EEG) channels in routine polysomnography. Two thousand nights were partitioned 
into equal (n = 1000) training and testing sets for validation. We used 
epoch-by-epoch Cohen's kappa statistics to measure the agreement between 
classifier output and human scorer according to American Academy of Sleep 
Medicine scoring criteria.
RESULTS: Epoch-by-epoch Cohen's kappa improved with increasing training EEG 
recordings until saturation occurred (n = ~300). The kappa value was further 
improved by accounting for contextual (temporal) information, increasing model 
complexity, and adjusting the model training procedure to account for the 
imbalance of stage proportions. The final kappa on the testing set was 0.68. 
Testing on more EEG recordings leads to kappa estimates with lower variance.
CONCLUSION: Training with a large data set enables automated sleep staging that 
compares favorably with human scorers. Because testing was performed on a large 
and heterogeneous data set, the performance estimate has low variance and is 
likely to generalize broadly.

Sleep disturbances increase with age and are predictors of mortality. Here, we 
present deep neural networks that estimate age and mortality risk through 
polysomnograms (PSGs). Aging was modeled using 2500 PSGs and tested in 10,699 
PSGs from men and women in seven different cohorts aged between 20 and 90. Ages 
were estimated with a mean absolute error of 5.8 ± 1.6 years, while basic sleep 
scoring measures had an error of 14.9 ± 6.29 years. After controlling for 
demographics, sleep, and health covariates, each 10-year increment in age 
estimate error (AEE) was associated with increased all-cause mortality rate of 
29% (95% confidence interval: 20-39%). An increase from -10 to +10 years in AEE 
translates to an estimated decreased life expectancy of 8.7 years (95% 
confidence interval: 6.1-11.4 years). Greater AEE was mostly reflected in 
increased sleep fragmentation, suggesting this is an important biomarker of 
future health independent of sleep apnea.

Should a sentinel node biopsy be performed in patients with high-risk breast 
cancer?

A negative sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy spares many breast cancer patients 
the complications associated with lymph node irradiation or additional surgery. 
However, patients at high risk for nodal involvement based on clinical 
characteristics may remain at unacceptably high risk of axillary disease even 
after a negative SLN biopsy result. A Bayesian nomogram was designed to combine 
the probability of axillary disease prior to nodal biopsy with customized test 
characteristics for an SLN biopsy and provides the probability of axillary 
disease despite a negative SLN biopsy. Users may individualize the sensitivity 
of an SLN biopsy based on factors known to modify the sensitivity of the 
procedure. This tool may be useful in identifying patients who should have 
expanded upfront exploration of the axilla or comprehensive axillary 
irradiation.

BACKGROUND: The etiology of altered consciousness in patients with high-grade 
aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is not thoroughly understood. We 
hypothesized that decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) in brain regions critical 
to consciousness may contribute.
: We retrospectively evaluated arterial-spin labeled (ASL) perfusion 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of CBF in 12 patients with 
aneurysmal SAH admitted to our neurocritical care unit. CBF values were analyzed 
within gray matter nodes of the default mode network (DMN), whose functional 
integrity has been shown to be necessary for consciousness. DMN nodes studied 
were the bilateral medial prefrontal cortices, thalami, and posterior cingulate 
cortices. Correlations between nodal CBF and admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 
score, admission Hunt and Hess (HH) class, and GCS score at the time of MRI (MRI 
GCS) were tested.
RESULTS: Spearman's correlation coefficients were not significant when comparing 
admission GCS, admission HH, and MRI GCS versus nodal CBF (p > 0.05). However, 
inter-rater reliability for nodal CBF was high (r = 0.71, p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective pilot study, we did not identify significant 
correlations between CBF and admission GCS, admission HH class, or MRI GCS for 
any DMN node. Potential explanations for these findings include small sample 
size, ASL data acquisition at variable times after SAH onset, and CBF analysis 
in DMN nodes that may not reflect the functional integrity of the entire 
network. High inter-rater reliability suggests ASL measurements of CBF within 
DMN nodes are reproducible. Larger prospective studies are needed to elucidate 
whether decreased cerebral perfusion contributes to altered consciousness in 
SAH.

OBJECTIVETo validate a system to detect ventilator associated events (VAEs) 
autonomously and in real time.DESIGNRetrospective review of ventilated patients 
using a secure informatics platform to identify VAEs (ie, automated 
surveillance) compared to surveillance by infection control (IC) staff (ie, 
manual surveillance), including development and validation cohorts.SETTINGThe 
Massachusetts General Hospital, a tertiary-care academic health center, during 
January-March 2015 (development cohort) and January-March 2016 (validation 
cohort).PATIENTSVentilated patients in 4 intensive care units.The 
automated process included  analysis of physiologic data to detect increases 
in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and fraction of inspired oxygen 
(FiO2); (2) querying the electronic health record (EHR) for leukopenia or 
leukocytosis and antibiotic initiation data; and (3) retrieval and 
interpretation of microbiology reports. The cohorts were evaluated as follows: 
 manual surveillance by IC staff with independent chart review; (2) automated 
surveillance detection of ventilator-associated condition (VAC), 
infection-related ventilator-associated complication (IVAC), and possible VAP 
(PVAP); (3) senior IC staff adjudicated manual surveillance-automated 
surveillance discordance. Outcomes included sensitivity, specificity, positive 
predictive value (PPV), and manual surveillance detection errors. Errors 
detected during the development cohort resulted in algorithm updates applied to 
the validation cohort.RESULTSIn the development cohort, there were 1,325 
admissions, 479 ventilated patients, 2,539 ventilator days, and 47 VAEs. In the 
validation cohort, there were 1,234 admissions, 431 ventilated patients, 2,604 
ventilator days, and 56 VAEs. With manual surveillance, in the development 
cohort, sensitivity was 40%, specificity was 98%, and PPV was 70%. In the 
validation cohort, sensitivity was 71%, specificity was 98%, and PPV was 87%. 
With automated surveillance, in the development cohort, sensitivity was 100%, 
specificity was 100%, and PPV was 100%. In the validation cohort, sensitivity 
was 85%, specificity was 99%, and PPV was 100%. Manual surveillance detection 
errors included missed detections, misclassifications, and false 
detections.CONCLUSIONSManual surveillance is vulnerable to human error. 
Automated surveillance is more accurate and more efficient for VAE 
surveillance.Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2018;826-833.

BACKGROUND: A medically induced coma is an anesthetic state of profound brain 
inactivation created to treat status epilepticus and to provide cerebral 
protection after traumatic brain injuries. The s hypothesized that a 
closed-loop anesthetic delivery system could automatically and precisely control 
the electroencephalogram state of burst suppression and efficiently maintain a 
medically induced coma.
: In six rats, the s implemented a closed-loop anesthetic delivery 
system for propofol consisting of: a computer-controlled pump infusion, a 
two-compartment pharmacokinetics model defining propofol's electroencephalogram 
effects, the burst-suppression probability algorithm to compute in real time 
from the electroencephalogram the brain's burst-suppression state, an online 
parameter-estimation procedure and a proportional-integral controller. In the 
control experiment each rat was randomly assigned to one of the six 
burst-suppression probability target trajectories constructed by permuting the 
burst-suppression probability levels of 0.4, 0.65, and 0.9 with linear 
transitions between levels.
RESULTS: In each animal the controller maintained approximately 60 min of tight, 
real-time control of burst suppression by tracking each burst-suppression 
probability target level for 15 min and two between-level transitions for 5-10 
min. The posterior probability that the closed-loop anesthetic delivery system 
was reliable across all levels was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.77-1.00; n = 18) and that the 
system was accurate across all levels was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.84-1.00; n = 18).
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study establish the feasibility of using a 
closed-loop anesthetic delivery systems to achieve in real time reliable and 
accurate control of burst suppression in rodents and suggest a paradigm to 
precisely control medically induced coma in patients.

Burst suppression (BS) is an electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern that is 
characterized by brief bursts of spikes, sharp waves, or slow waves of 
relatively high amplitude alternating with periods of relatively flat EEG or 
isoelectric periods. The pattern is usually associated with coma, severe 
encephalopathy of various etiologies, or general anesthesia. We describe an 
unusual case of anoxic brain injury in which a BS pattern was seen during 
behaviorally defined sleep during a routine outpatient EEG study.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral microinfarcts (CMI) are important contributors 
to vascular cognitive impairment. Magnetic resonance imaging diffusion-weighted 
imaging (DWI) hyperintensities have been suggested to represent acute CMI. We 
aim to describe a mathematical method for estimating total number of CMI based 
on the presence of incidental DWI lesions.
: We reviewed magnetic resonance imaging scans of subjects with cognitive 
decline, cognitively normal subjects and previously reported subjects with past 
intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Based on temporal and spatial characteristics of 
DWI lesions, we estimated the annual rate of CMI needed to explain the observed 
rate of DWI lesion detection in each group. To confirm our estimates, we 
performed extensive sampling for CMI in the brain of a deceased subject with 
past lobar ICH who found to have a DWI lesion during life.
RESULTS: Clinically silent DWI lesions were present in 13 of 343 (3.8%) 
cognitively impaired and 10 of 199 (5%) cognitively intact normal non-ICH 
patients, both lower than the incidence in the past ICH patients (23 of 178; 
12.9%; P<0.0006). The predicted annual incidence of CMI ranges from 16 to 1566 
for non-ICH and 50 to 5041 for ICH individuals. Histological sampling revealed a 
total of 60 lesions in 32 sections. Based on previously reported , this 
density of CMI yields an estimated total brain burden maximum likelihood 
estimate of 9321 CMIs (95% confidence interval, 7255-11 990).
CONCLUSIONS: Detecting even a single DWI lesion suggests an annual incidence of 
hundreds of new CMI. The cumulative effects of these lesions may directly 
contribute to small-vessel-related vascular cognitive impairment.

PURPOSE: Neuroimaging is critical in deciding candidacy for epilepsy surgery. 
Currently imaging is primarily assessed qualitatively, which may affect patient 
selection and outcomes.
METHOD: The epilepsy surgery database at MGH was reviewed for temporal lobectomy 
patients from the last 10 years. Radiology reports for MRI and FDG-PET were 
compared to the epilepsy conference consensus. First, specific findings of 
ipsi/contra hippocampal atrophy and T2 signal changes were directly compared. 
Next the overall impression of presence of hippocampal sclerosis (HS) for MRI 
and temporal hypometabolism for PET was used for sensitivity/specificity 
analysis. To assess predictive power of imaging findings logistic regression was 
used.
RESULTS: 104 subjects were identified. 70% of subjects were ILAE class I at 
1-year. Radiology reports and the conference consensus differed in 31% of 
FDG-PET studies and 41% of MRIs. For PET most disagreement (50%) stemmed for 
discrepancy regarding contralateral temporal hypometabolism. For MRI discrepancy 
in ipsilateral hippocampal atrophy/T2 signal accounted for 59% of disagreements. 
When overall impression of the image was used the overall reliability between 
groups was high with only MRI sensitivity to detect HS (0.75 radiology, 0.91 
conference, p=0.02) was significantly different between groups. On logistic 
regression MRI was a significant predictor of HS, but still 36% of patients with 
normal MRI as read by both groups had HS on pathology.
CONCLUSION: Despite some difference in specific radiologic findings, overall 
accuracy for MRI and PET is similar in clinical practice between radiology and 
conference; nonetheless there are still cases of hippocampal pathology not 
detected by standard imaging .

OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical correlates bilateral independent periodic 
discharges (BIPDs) and their association with electrographic seizures and 
outcome.
: Retrospective case-control study of patients with BIPDs compared to 
patients without periodic discharges ("No PDs") and patients with lateralized 
periodic discharges ("LPDs"), matched for age, etiology and level of alertness.
RESULTS: We included 85 cases and 85 controls in each group. The most frequent 
etiologies of BIPDs were stroke, CNS infections, and anoxic brain injury. Acute 
bilateral cerebral injury was more common in the BIPDs group than in the No PDs 
and LPDs groups (70% vs. 37% vs. 35%). Electrographic seizures were more common 
with BIPDs than in the absence of PDs (45% vs. 8%), but not than with LPDs 
(52%). Mortality was higher in the BIPDs group (36%) than in the No PDs group 
(18%), with fewer patients with BIPDs achieving good outcome (moderate 
disability or better; 18% vs. 36%), but not than in the LPDs group (24% 
mortality, 26% good outcome). In multivariate analyses, BIPDs remained 
associated with mortality (OR: 3.0 [1.4-6.4]) and poor outcome (OR: 2.9 
[1.4-6.2]).
CONCLUSION: BIPDs are caused by bilateral acute brain injury and are associated 
with a high risk of electrographic seizures and of poor outcome.
SIGNIFICANCE: BIPDs are uncommon but their identification in critically ill 
patients has potential important implications, both in terms of clinical 
management and prognostication.

Time series motifs are sets of very similar subsequences of a long time series. 
They are of  in their own right, and are also used as inputs in several 
higher-level data mining algorithms including classification, clustering, 
rule-discovery and summarization. In spite of extensive research in recent 
years, finding time series motifs exactly in massive databases is an open 
problem. Previous efforts either found approximate motifs or considered 
relatively small datasets residing in main memory. In this work, we leverage off 
previous work on pivot-based indexing to introduce a disk-aware algorithm to 
find time series motifs exactly in multi-gigabyte databases which contain on the 
order of tens of millions of time series. We have evaluated our algorithm on 
datasets from diverse areas including medicine, anthropology, computer 
networking and image processing and show that we can find ing and 
meaningful motifs in datasets that are many orders of magnitude larger than 
anything considered before.

PURPOSE: Persistent uncertainty over the clinical significance of various 
pathological continuous electroencephalography (cEEG) findings in the intensive 
care unit (ICU) has prompted efforts to standardize ICU cEEG terminology and an 
ensuing debate. We set out to understand the reasons for, and a satisfactory 
resolution to, this debate.
METHOD: We review the positions for and against standardization, and examine 
their deeper philosophical basis.
RESULTS: We find that the positions for and against standardization are not 
fundamentally irreconcilable. Rather, both positions stem from conflating the 
three cardinal steps in the classic approach to EEG, which we term 
"description", "interpretation", and "prescription". Using real-world examples 
we show how this conflation yields muddled clinical reasoning and unproductive 
debate among electroencephalographers that is translated into confusion among 
treating clinicians. We propose a middle way that judiciously uses both 
standardized terminology and clinical reasoning to disentangle these critical 
steps and apply them in proper sequence.
CONCLUSION: The systematic approach to ICU cEEG findings presented herein not 
only resolves the standardization debate but also clarifies clinical reasoning 
by helping electroencephalographers assign appropriate weights to cEEG findings 
in the face of uncertainty.

We developed a simple and fully automated method for detecting artifacts in the 
R-R interval (RRI) time series of the ECG that is tailored to the intensive care 
unit (ICU) setting. From ECG recordings of 50 adult ICU-subjects we selected 60 
epochs with valid R-peak detections and 60 epochs containing artifacts leading 
to missed or false positive R-peak detections. Next, we calculated the absolute 
value of the difference between two adjacent RRIs (adRRI), and obtained the 
empirical probability distributions of adRRI values for valid R-peaks and 
artifacts. From these, we calculated an optimal threshold for separating adRRI 
values arising from artifact versus non-artefactual data. We compared the 
performance of our method with the  of Berntson and Clifford on the same 
data. We identified 257,458 R-peak detections, of which 235,644 (91.5%) were 
true detections and 21,814 (8.5%) arose from artifacts. Our method showed 
superior performance for detecting artifacts with sensitivity 100%, specificity 
99%, precision 99%, positive likelihood ratio of 100 and negative likelihood 
ratio <0.001 compared to Berntson's and Clifford's method with a sensitivity, 
specificity, precision and positive and negative likelihood ratio of 99%, 78%, 
82%, 4.5, 0.013 for Berntson's method and 55%, 98%, 96%, 27.5, 0.460 for 
Clifford's method, respectively. A novel algorithm using a patient-independent 
threshold derived from the distribution of adRRI values in ICU ECG data 
identifies artifacts accurately, and outperforms two other  in common 
use. Furthermore, the threshold was calculated based on real data from 
critically ill patients and the algorithm is easy to implement.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study was to measure the performance of academic and 
private practice (PP) neurologists in detecting interictal epileptiform 
discharges in routine scalp EEG recordings.
: Thirty-five EEG scorers (EEGers) participated (19 academic and 16 PP) 
and marked the location of ETs in 200 30-second EEG segments using a web-based 
EEG annotation system. All participants provided board certification status, 
years of Epilepsy Fellowship Training (EFT), and years in practice. The Persyst 
P13 automated IED detection algorithm was also run on the EEG segments for 
comparison.
RESULTS: Academic EEGers had an average of 1.66 years of EFT versus 0.50 years 
of EFT for PP EEGers (P < 0.0001) and had higher rates of board certification. 
Inter-rater agreement for the 35 EEGers was fair. There was higher performance 
for EEGers in academics, with at least 1.5 years of EFT, and with American Board 
of Clinical Neurophysiology and American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology-E 
specialty board certification. The Persyst P13 algorithm at its default setting 
(perception value = 0.4) did not perform as well at the EEGers, but at 
substantially higher perception value settings, the algorithm performed almost 
as well human experts.
CONCLUSIONS: Inter-rater agreement among EEGers in both academic and PP settings 
varies considerably. Practice location, years of EFT, and board certification 
are associated with significantly higher performance for IED detection in 
routine scalp EEG. Continued medical education of PP neurologists and 
neurologists without EFT is needed to improve routine scalp EEG interpretation 
skills. The performance of automated detection algorithms is approaching that of 
human experts.

The PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2018 focused on the use of 
various physiological signals (EEG, EOG, EMG, ECG, SaO2) collected during 
polysomnographic sleep studies to detect sources of arousal (non-apnea) during 
sleep. A total of 1,983 polysomnographic recordings were made available to the 
entrants. The arousal labels for 994 of the recordings were made available in a 
public training set while 989 labels were retained in a hidden test set. 
Challengers were asked to develop an algorithm that could label the presence of 
arousals within the hidden test set. The performance metric used to assess 
entrants was the area under the precision-recall curve. A total of twenty-two 
independent teams entered the Challenge, deploying a variety of  from 
generalized linear models to deep neural networks.

OBJECTIVES: To measure the diagnostic accuracy, timeliness, and ease of use of 
Ceribell rapid response electroencephalography. We assessed physicians' 
diagnostic assessments and treatment plans before and after rapid response 
electroencephalography assessment. Primary outcomes were changes in physicians' 
diagnostic and therapeutic decision making and their confidence in these 
decisions based on the use of the rapid response electroencephalography system. 
Secondary outcomes were time to electroencephalography, setup time, ease of use, 
and quality of electroencephalography data.
DESIGN: Prospective multicenter nonrandomized observational study.
SETTING: ICUs in five academic hospitals in the United States.
SUBJECTS: Patients with encephalopathy suspected of having nonconvulsive 
seizures and physicians evaluating these patients.
INTERVENTIONS: Physician bedside assessment of sonified electroencephalography 
(30 s from each hemisphere) and visual electroencephalography (60 s) using rapid 
response electroencephalography.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Physicians (29 fellows or residents, eight 
attending neurologists) evaluated 181 ICU patients; complete clinical and 
electroencephalography data were available in 164 patients (average 58.6 ± 18.7 
yr old, 45% females). Relying on rapid response electroencephalography 
information at the bedside improved the sensitivity (95% CI) of physicians' 
seizure diagnosis from 77.8% (40.0%, 97.2%) to 100% (66.4%, 100%) and the 
specificity (95% CI) of their diagnosis from 63.9% (55.8%, 71.4%) to 89% (83.0%, 
93.5%). Physicians' confidence in their own diagnosis and treatment plan were 
also improved. Time to electroencephalography (median [interquartile range]) was 
5 minutes (4-10 min) with rapid response electroencephalography while the 
conventional electroencephalography was delayed by several hours (median 
[interquartile range] delay = 239 minutes [134-471 min] [p < 0.0001 using 
Wilcoxon signed rank test]). The device was rated as easy to use (mean ± SD: 4.7 
± 0.6 [1 = difficult, 5 = easy]) and was without serious adverse effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Rapid response electroencephalography enabled timely and more 
accurate assessment of patients in the critical care setting. The use of rapid 
response electroencephalography may be clinically beneficial in the assessment 
of patients with high suspicion for nonconvulsive seizures and status 
epilepticus.

OBJECTIVES: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may contribute to impaired performance 
among otherwise healthy active duty military personnel. We used decision 
analysis to evaluate three approaches to identifying and treating OSA in 
low-risk populations, which may differ from current standard practice for 
high-risk populations.
: We developed a decision tree to compare two simple strategies for 
diagnosis and management of sleep apnea in a low-risk population. In one 
strategy, a simple screening inventory was followed by conventional laboratory 
polysomnography (split-night), whereas the alternative strategy involved 
performing home testing in all individuals. This allowed us to weigh the costs 
associated with large-scale diagnostic approaches against the costs of untreated 
OSA in a small fraction of the population.
RESULTS: We found that the home testing approach was less expensive than the 
screen-then-test approach across a broad range of other important parameters, 
including the annual performance cost associated with untreated OSA, the 
prevalence of OSA, and the duration of active duty.
CONCLUSIONS: Assuming even modest annual performance costs associated with 
untreated OSA, a population strategy involving large-scale home testing is less 
expensive than a screening inventory approach. These results may inform either 
targeted or large-scale investigation of undiagnosed OSA in low-risk populations 
such as active duty military.

BACKGROUND: EEG interpretation relies on experts who are in short supply. There 
is a great need for automated pattern recognition systems to assist with 
interpretation. However, attempts to develop such systems have been limited by 
insufficient expert-annotated data. To address these issues, we developed a 
system named NeuroBrowser for EEG review and rapid waveform annotation.
NEW : At the core of NeuroBrowser lies on ultrafast template matching 
under Dynamic Time Warping, which substantially accelerates the task of 
annotation.
RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that NeuroBrowser can reduce the time required 
for annotation of interictal epileptiform discharges by EEG experts by 20-90%, 
with an average of approximately 70%.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): In comparison with conventional manual EEG 
annotation, NeuroBrowser is able to save EEG experts approximately 70% on 
average of the time spent in annotating interictal epileptiform discharges. We 
have already extracted 19,000+ interictal epileptiform discharges from 100 
patient EEG recordings. To our knowledge this represents the largest annotated 
database of interictal epileptiform discharges in existence.
CONCLUSION: NeuroBrowser is an integrated system for rapid waveform annotation. 
While the algorithm is currently tailored to annotation of interictal 
epileptiform discharges in scalp EEG recordings, the concepts can be easily

BACKGROUND: Stimulus-induced electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns are commonly 
seen in acutely ill patients undergoing continuous EEG monitoring. Despite 
ongoing investigations, the pathophysiology, therapeutic and prognostic 
significance of stimulus-induced rhythmic, periodic or ictal discharges 
(SIRPIDs) and how it applies to specific pathologies remain unclear. We aimed to 
investigate the clinical implications of SIRPIDs in hospitalized patients.
: This is a retrospective single-center study of hospitalized patients 
from May 2016 to August 2017. We included patients above the age of 18 years who 
underwent >16 h of EEG monitoring during a single admission. We excluded 
patients with cardiac arrest and anoxic brain injury. Demographic data were 
obtained as well as admission GCS, and discharge modified Rankin Score (mRS). 
EEGs were reviewed for background activity in addition to epileptiform, 
periodic, and rhythmic patterns. The presence or absence of SIRPIDs was 
recorded. Our outcome was discharge mRS defined as good outcome, mRS 0-4, and 
poor outcome mRS, 5-6.
RESULTS: A total of 351 patients were included in the final analysis. The median 
age was 63 years and 175 (50%) were women. SIRPIDs were identified in 82 
patients (23.4%). Patients with SIRPIDs had a median initial GCS of 12 (IQR, 
6-15) and a length of stay of 12 days (IQR, 6-15). They were more likely to have 
absent posterior dominant rhythm, decreased reactivity, and more likely to have 
spontaneous periodic and rhythmic patterns and higher frequency of burst 
suppression. After adjusting for baseline clinical variables, underlying disease 
type and severity, and EEG background features, the presence of SIRPIDs was also 
associated with poor outcomes classified as MRS 5 or 6 (OR 4.75 [2.74-8.24] p ≤ 
0.0001).
CONCLUSION: In our cohort of hospitalized patients excluding anoxic brain 
injury, SIRPIDs were identified in 23.4% and were seen most commonly in patients 
with primary systemic illness. We found SIRPIDs were independently associated 
with poor neurologic outcomes. Several studies are indicated to validate these 
findings and determine the risks vs. benefits of anti-seizure treatment.

Both sleep and wake encephalograms (EEG) change over the lifespan. While prior 
studies have characterized age-related changes in the EEG, the datasets span a 
particular age group, or focused on sleep and wake macrostructure rather than 
the microstructure. Here, we present sex-stratified data from 3372 
community-based or clinic-based otherwise neurologically and psychiatrically 
healthy participants ranging from 11 days to 80 years of age. We estimate age 
norms for key sleep and wake EEG parameters including absolute and relative 
powers in delta, theta, alpha, and sigma bands, as well as sleep spindle 
density, amplitude, duration, and frequency. To illustrate the potential use of 
the reference measures developed herein, we compare them to sleep EEG recordings 
from age-matched participants with Alzheimer's disease, severe sleep apnea, 
depression, osteoarthritis, and osteoporosis. Although the partially clinical 
nature of the datasets may bias the findings towards less normal and hence may 
underestimate pathology in practice, age-based EEG reference values enable 
objective screening of deviations from healthy aging among individuals with a 
variety of disorders that affect brain health.

BACKGROUND: The delirium-sparing effect of nighttime dexmedetomidine has not 
been studied after surgery. We hypothesised that a nighttime dose of 
dexmedetomidine would reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium as compared 
to placebo.
: This single-centre, parallel-arm, randomised, placebo-controlled 
superiority trial evaluated whether a short nighttime dose of intravenous 
dexmedetomidine (1 μg/kg over 40 min) would reduce the incidence of 
postoperative delirium in patients 60 years of age or older undergoing elective 
cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients were randomised to receive 
dexmedetomidine or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was delirium on 
postoperative day one. Secondary outcomes included delirium within three days of 
surgery, 30-, 90-, and 180-day abbreviated Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores, 
Patient Reported Outcome Measures Information System quality of life scores, and 
all-cause mortality. The study was registered as NCT02856594 on 
ClinicalTrials.gov on August 5, 2016, before the enrolment of any participants.
FINDINGS: Of 469 patients that underwent randomisation to placebo (n = 235) or 
dexmedetomidine (n = 234), 75 met a prespecified drop criterion before the study 
intervention. Thus, 394 participants (188 dexmedetomidine; 206 placebo) were 
analysed in the modified intention-to-treat cohort (median age 69 [IQR 64, 74] 
years; 73.1% male [n = 288]; 26·9% female [n = 106]). Postoperative delirium 
status on day one was missing for 30 (7.6%) patients. Among those in whom it 
could be assessed, the primary outcome occurred in 5 of 175 patients (2.9%) in 
the dexmedetomidine group and 16 of 189 patients (8.5%) in the placebo group (OR 
0.32, 95% CI: 0.10-0.83; P = 0.029). A non-significant but higher proportion of 
participants experienced delirium within three days postoperatively in the 
placebo group (25/177; 14.1%) compared to the dexmedetomidine group (14/160; 
8.8%; OR 0.58; 95% CI, 0.28-1.15). No significant differences between groups 
were observed in secondary outcomes or safety.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggested that in elderly cardiac surgery patients 
with a low baseline risk of postoperative delirium and extubated within 12 h of 
ICU admission, a short nighttime dose of dexmedetomidine decreased the incidence 
of delirium on postoperative day one. Although non-statistically significant, 
our findings also suggested a clinical meaningful difference in the three-day 
incidence of postoperative delirium.

OBJECTIVE: Interictal epileptiform discharges on EEG are integral to diagnosing 
epilepsy. However, EEGs are interpreted by readers with and without specialty 
training, and there is no accepted method to assess skill in interpretation. We 
aimed to develop a test to quantify IED recognition skills.
: A total of 13,262 candidate IEDs were selected from EEGs and scored by 
eight fellowship-trained reviewers to establish a gold standard. An online test 
was developed to assess how well readers with different training levels could 
distinguish candidate waveforms. Sensitivity, false positive rate and 
calibration were calculated for each reader. A simple mathematical model was 
developed to estimate each reader's skill and threshold in identifying an IED, 
and to develop receiver operating characteristics curves for each reader. We 
investigated the number of IEDs needed to measure skill level with acceptable 
precision.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine raters completed the test; nine experts, seven experienced 
non-experts and thirteen novices. Median calibration errors for experts, 
experienced non-experts and novices were -0.056, 0.012, 0.046; median 
sensitivities were 0.800, 0.811, 0.715; and median false positive rates were 
0.177, 0.272, 0.396, respectively. The number of test questions needed to 
measure those scores was 549. Our analysis identiﬁed that novices had a higher 
noise level (uncertainty) compared to experienced non-experts and experts. Using 
calculated noise and threshold levels, receiver operating curves were created, 
showing increasing median area under the curve from novices (0.735), to 
experienced non-experts (0.852) and experts (0.891).
SIGNIFICANCE: Expert and non-expert readers can be distinguished based on 
ability to identify IEDs. This type of assessment could also be used to identify 
and correct differences in thresholds in identifying IEDs.

BACKGROUND: Hypoglycemic coma (HC) is an uncommon but severe clinical condition 
associated with poor neurological outcome. There is a dearth of robust 
neurological prognostic factors after HC. On the other hand, there is an 
increasing body of literature on reliable prognostic markers in the postanoxic 
coma, a similar-albeit not identical-situation. The objective of this study was 
thus to investigate the use and predictive value of these markers in HC.
: We conducted a retrospective, multicenter, cohort study within five 
centers of the Critical Care EEG Monitoring Research Consortium. We queried our 
electroencephalography (EEG) databases to identify all patients undergoing 
continuous EEG monitoring after admission to an intensive care unit with HC 
(defined as Glasgow Coma Scale < 8 on admission and a first blood glucose 
level < 50 mg/dL or not documented but in an obvious clinical context) between 
01/01/2010 and 12/31/2020. We studied the association of findings at 
neurological examination (Glasgow Coma Scale motor subscale, pupillary light and 
corneal reflexes) and at continuous EEG monitoring(highly malignant patterns, 
reactivity, periodic discharges, seizures) with best neurological outcome within 
3 months after hospital discharge, defined by the Cerebral Performance Category 
as favorable (1-3: recovery of consciousness) versus unfavorable (4-5: lack of 
recovery of consciousness).
RESULTS: We identified 60 patients (30 [50%] women; age 62 [51-72] years). 
Thirty-one and 29 patients had a favorable and unfavorable outcome, 
respectively. The presence of pupillary reflexes (24 [100%] vs. 17 [81%]; p 
value 0.04) and a motor subscore > 2 (22 [92%] vs. 12 [63%]; p value 0.03) at 
48-72 h were associated with a favorable outcome. A highly malignant EEG pattern 
was observed in 7 of 29 (24%) patients with unfavorable outcome versus 0 of 31 
(0%) with favorable outcome, whereas the presence of EEG reactivity was observed 
in 28 of 31 (90%) patients with favorable outcome versus 13 of 29 (45%) with 
unfavorable outcome (p < 0.001 for comparison of all background categories).
CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study suggests that highly malignant EEG patterns 
might be reliable prognostic markers of unfavorable outcome after HC. Other EEG 
findings, including lack of EEG reactivity and seizures and clinical findings 
appear less accurate. These findings should be replicated in a larger 
multicenter prospective study.

Predicting Neurological Outcome From Electroencephalogram Dynamics in Comatose 
Patients After Cardiac Arrest With Deep Learning.

Zheng WL, Amorim E, Jing J, Wu O, Ghassemi M, Lee JW, Sivaraju A, Pang T, Herman 
ST, Gaspard N, Ruijter BJ, Tjepkema-Cloostermans MC, Hofmeijer J, van Putten 
MJAM, Westover MB.

OBJECTIVE: Most cardiac arrest patients who are successfully resuscitated are 
initially comatose due to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Quantitative 
electroencephalography (EEG) provides valuable prognostic information. However, 
prior approaches largely rely on snapshots of the EEG, without taking advantage 
of temporal information.
: We present a recurrent deep neural network with the goal of capturing 
temporal dynamics from longitudinal EEG data to predict long-term neurological 
outcomes. We utilized a large international dataset of continuous EEG recordings 
from 1,038 cardiac arrest patients from seven hospitals in Europe and the US. 
Poor outcome was defined as a Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score of 3-5, 
and good outcome as CPC score 0-2 at 3 to 6-months after cardiac arrest. Model 
performance is evaluated using 5-fold cross validation.
RESULTS: The proposed approach provides predictions which improve over time, 
beginning from an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUC-ROC) of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.72-0.81) at 12 hours, and reaching 0.88 (95% CI: 
0.85-0.91) by 66 h after cardiac arrest. At 66 h, (sensitivity, specificity) 
points of  on the ROC curve for predicting poor outcomes were (32,99)%, 
(55,95)%, and (62,90)%, (99,23)%, (95,47)%, and (90,62)%; whereas for predicting 
good outcome, the corresponding operating points were (17,99)%, (47,95)%, 
(62,90)%, (99,19)%, (95,48)%, (70,90)%. Moreover, the model provides predicted 
probabilities that closely match the observed frequencies of good and poor 
outcomes (calibration error 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that accounting for EEG 
trend information can substantially improve prediction of neurologic outcomes 
for patients with coma following cardiac arrest.

Automated Scoring of Respiratory Events in Sleep With a Single Effort Belt and 
Deep Neural Networks.

Nassi TE, Ganglberger W, Sun H, Bucklin AA, Biswal S, van Putten MJAM, Thomas 
RJ, Westover MB.

OBJECTIVE: Automatic detection and analysis of respiratory events in sleep using 
a single respiratoryeffort belt and deep learning.
: Using 9,656 polysomnography recordings from the Massachusetts General 
Hospital (MGH), we trained a neural network (WaveNet) to detect obstructive 
apnea, central apnea, hypopnea and respiratory-effort related arousals. 
Performance evaluation included event-based analysis and apnea-hypopnea index 
(AHI) stratification. The model was further evaluated on a public dataset, the 
Sleep-Heart-Health-Study-1, containing 8,455 polysomnographic recordings.
RESULTS: For binary apnea event detection in the MGH dataset, the neural network 
obtained a sensitivity of 68%, a specificity of 98%, a precision of 65%, a 
F1-score of 67%, and an area under the curve for the receiver operating 
characteristics curve and precision-recall curve of 0.93 and 0.71, respectively. 
AHI prediction resulted in a mean difference of 0.41 ± 7.8 and a r2 of 0.90. For 
the multiclass task, we obtained varying performances: 84% of all labeled 
central apneas were correctly classified, whereas this metric was 51% for 
obstructive apneas, 40% for respiratory effort related arousals and 23% for 
hypopneas.
CONCLUSION: Our fully automated method can detect respiratory events and assess 
the AHI accurately. Differentiation of event types is more difficult and may 
reflect in part the complexity of human respiratory output and some degree of 
arbitrariness in the criteria used during manual annotation.
SIGNIFICANCE: The current gold standard of diagnosing sleep-disordered 
breathing, using polysomnography and manual analysis, is time-consuming, 
expensive, and only applicable in dedicated clinical environments. Automated 
analysis using a single effort belt signal overcomes these limitations.

IMPORTANCE: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect millions of people 
globally, with increasing reports of neurological manifestations but limited 
data on their incidence and associations with outcome.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the neurological phenotypes, incidence, and outcomes 
among adults hospitalized with COVID-19.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study included patients with 
clinically diagnosed or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 at 28 centers, 
representing 13 countries and 4 continents. The study was performed by the 
Global Consortium Study of Neurologic Dysfunction in COVID-19 (GCS-NeuroCOVID) 
from March 1 to September 30, 2020, and the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) 
Neuro-COVID Registry (ENERGY) from March to October 2020. Three cohorts were 
included:  the GCS-NeuroCOVID all COVID-19 cohort (n = 3055), which included 
consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with and without neurological 
manifestations; (2) the GCS-NeuroCOVID COVID-19 neurological cohort (n = 475), 
which comprised consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who had 
confirmed neurological manifestations; and (3) the ENERGY cohort (n = 214), 
which included patients with COVID-19 who received formal neurological 
consultation.
EXPOSURES: Clinically diagnosed or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Neurological phenotypes were classified as 
self-reported symptoms or neurological signs and/or syndromes assessed by 
clinical evaluation. Composite incidence was reported for groups with at least 1 
neurological manifestation. The main outcome measure was in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: Of the 3055 patients in the all COVID-19 cohort, 1742 (57%) were men, 
and the mean age was 59.9 years (95% CI, 59.3-60.6 years). Of the 475 patients 
in the COVID-19 neurological cohort, 262 (55%) were men, and the mean age was 
62.6 years (95% CI, 61.1-64.1 years). Of the 214 patients in the ENERGY cohort, 
133 (62%) were men, and the mean age was 67 years (95% CI, 52-78 years). A total 
of 3083 of 3743 patients (82%) across cohorts had any neurological manifestation 
(self-reported neurological symptoms and/or clinically captured neurological 
sign and/or syndrome). The most common self-reported symptoms included headache 
(1385 of 3732 patients [37%]) and anosmia or ageusia (977 of 3700 patients 
[26%]). The most prevalent neurological signs and/or syndromes were acute 
encephalopathy (1845 of 3740 patients [49%]), coma (649 of 3737 patients [17%]), 
and stroke (222 of 3737 patients [6%]), while meningitis and/or encephalitis 
were rare (19 of 3741 patients [0.5%]). Presence of clinically captured 
neurologic signs and/or syndromes was associated with increased risk of 
in-hospital death (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 5.99; 95% CI, 4.33-8.28) after 
adjusting for study site, age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Presence of preexisting 
neurological disorders (aOR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.80-2.75) was associated with 
increased risk of developing neurological signs and/or syndromes with COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this multicohort study, neurological 
manifestations were prevalent among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and were 
associated with higher in-hospital mortality. Preexisting neurological disorders 
were associated with increased risk of developing neurological signs and/or 
syndromes in COVID-19.

    J Neurol Sci. 2021 Jan 15;421:117308.

IMPORTANCE: Microvascular lesions are common in patients with severe COVID-19. 
Radiologic-pathologic correlation in one case suggests a combination of 
microvascular hemorrhagic and ischemic lesions that may reflect an underlying 
hypoxic mechanism of injury, which requires validation in larger studies.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence, distribution, and clinical and 
histopathologic correlates of microvascular lesions in patients with severe 
COVID-19.
DESIGN: Observational, retrospective cohort study: March to May 2020.
SETTING: Single academic medical center.
PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients (16) admitted to the intensive care unit with 
severe COVID-19, undergoing brain MRI for evaluation of coma or focal neurologic 
deficits.
EXPOSURES: Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Hypointense microvascular lesions identified by a 
prototype ultrafast high-resolution susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) MRI 
sequence, counted by two neuroradiologists and categorized by neuroanatomic 
location. Clinical and laboratory data (most recent measurements before brain 
MRI). Brain autopsy and cerebrospinal fluid PCR for SARS-CoV 2 in one patient 
who died from severe COVID-19.
RESULTS: Eleven of 16 patients (69%) had punctate and linear SWI lesions in the 
subcortical and deep white matter, and eight patients (50%) had >10 SWI lesions. 
In 4/16 patients (25%), lesions involved the corpus callosum. Brain autopsy in 
one patient revealed that SWI lesions corresponded to widespread microvascular 
injury, characterized by perivascular and parenchymal petechial hemorrhages and 
microscopic ischemic lesions.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: SWI lesions are common in patients with neurological 
manifestations of severe COVID-19 (coma and focal neurologic deficits). The 
distribution of lesions is similar to that seen in patients with hypoxic 
respiratory failure, sepsis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. 
Collectively, these radiologic and histopathologic findings suggest that 
patients with severe COVID-19 are at risk for multifocal microvascular 
hemorrhagic and ischemic lesions in the subcortical and deep white matter.

Clinical Electroencephalography Findings and Considerations in Hospitalized 
Patients with Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

Update in
    Neurohospitalist. 2021 Jul;11(3):204-213.

Background and Purpose Reports have suggested that severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes neurologic manifestations including 
encephalopathy and seizures. However, there has been relatively limited 
electrophysiology data to contextualize these specific concerns and to 
understand their associated clinical factors. Our objective was to identify EEG 
abnormalities present in patients with SARS-CoV-2, and to determine whether they 
reflect new or preexisting brain pathology.  We studied a consecutive 
series of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 who received an EEG, obtained 
using tailored safety protocols. Data from EEG reports and clinical records were 
analyzed to identify EEG abnormalities and possible clinical associations, 
including neurologic symptoms, new or preexisting brain pathology, and sedation 
practices. Results We identified 37 patients with SARS-CoV-2 who underwent EEG, 
of whom 14 had epileptiform findings (38%). Patients with epileptiform findings 
were more likely to have preexisting brain pathology (6/14, 43%) than patients 
without epileptiform findings (2/23, 9%; p=0.042). There were no clear 
differences in rates of acute brain pathology. One case of nonconvulsive status 
epilepticus was captured, but was not clearly a direct consequence of 
SARS-CoV-2. Abnormalities of background rhythms were common, and patients 
recently sedated were more likely to lack a posterior dominant rhythm (p=0.022). 
Conclusions Epileptiform abnormalities were common in patients with SARS-CoV-2 
referred for EEG, but particularly in the context of preexisting brain pathology 
and sedation. These findings suggest that neurologic manifestations during 
SARS-CoV-2 infection may not solely relate to the infection itself, but rather 
may also reflect patients' broader, preexisting neurologic vulnerabilities.

BACKGROUND: We sought to develop an automatable score to predict 
hospitalization, critical illness, or death in patients at risk for COVID-19 
presenting for urgent care during the Massachusetts outbreak.
: Single-center study of adult outpatients seen in respiratory illness 
clinics (RICs) or the emergency department (ED), including development (n = 
9381, March 7-May 2) and prospective (n = 2205, May 3-14) cohorts. Data was 
queried from Partners Enterprise Data Warehouse. Outcomes were hospitalization, 
critical illness or death within 7 days. We developed the COVID-19 Acuity Score 
(CoVA) using automatically extracted data from the electronic medical record and 
learning-to-rank ordinal logistic regression modeling. Calibration was assessed 
using predicted-to-observed event ratio (E/O). Discrimination was assessed by 
C-statistics (AUC).
RESULTS: In the development cohort, 27.3%, 7.2%, and 1.1% of patients 
experienced hospitalization, critical illness, or death, respectively; and in 
the prospective cohort, 26.1%, 6.3%, and 0.5%. CoVA showed excellent performance 
in the development cohort (concurrent validation) for hospitalization (E/O: 
1.00, AUC: 0.80); for critical illness (E/O: 1.00, AUC: 0.82); and for death 
(E/O: 1.00, AUC: 0.87). Performance in the prospective cohort (prospective 
validation) was similar for hospitalization (E/O: 1.01, AUC: 0.76); for critical 
illness (E/O 1.03, AUC: 0.79); and for death (E/O: 1.63, AUC=0.93). Among 30 
predictors, the top five were age, diastolic blood pressure, blood oxygen 
saturation, COVID-19 testing status, and respiratory rate.
CONCLUSIONS: CoVA is a prospectively validated automatable score to assessing 
risk for adverse outcomes related to COVID-19 infection in the outpatient 
setting.

Innate immune signaling in the olfactory epithelium reduces odorant receptor 
levels: modeling transient smell loss in COVID-19 patients.

Rodriguez S, Cao L, Rickenbacher GT, Benz EG, Magdamo C, Ramirez Gomez LA, 
Holbrook E, Dhilla Albers A, Gallagher R, Westover MB, Evans KE, Tatar D, 
Mukerji S, Zafonte R, Boyer EW, Yu CR, Albers MW.

Post-infectious anosmias typically follow death of olfactory sensory neurons 
(OSNs) with a months-long recovery phase associated with parosmias. While 
profound anosmia is the leading symptom associated with COVID-19 infection, many 
patients regain olfactory function within days to weeks without distortions. 
Here, we demonstrate that sterile induction of anti-viral type I interferon 
signaling in the mouse olfactory epithelium is associated with diminished odor 
discrimination and reduced odor-evoked local field potentials. RNA levels of all 
class I, class II, and TAAR odorant receptors are markedly reduced in OSNs in a 
non-cell autonomous manner. We find that people infected with COVID-19 rate 
odors with lower intensities and have odor discrimination deficits relative to 
people that tested negative for COVID-19. Taken together, we propose that 
inflammatory-mediated loss of odorant receptor expression with preserved circuit 
integrity accounts for the profound anosmia and rapid recovery of olfactory 
function without parosmias caused by COVID-19.

Drug-Specific Models Improve the Performance of an EEG-based Automated 
Brain-State Prediction System.

Mekonnen J, Pedemonte J, Murphy JM, Sun H, Westover MB, Akeju O.

Maintaining anesthetic states using automated brain-state prediction systems is 
expected to reduce drug overdosage and associated side-effects. However, 
commercially available brain-state monitoring systems perform poorly on 
drug-class combinations. We assume that current automated brain-state prediction 
systems perform poorly because they do not account for brain-state dynamics that 
are unique to drug-class combinations. In this work, we develop a k-nearest 
neighbors model to test whether improvements to automated brain-state prediction 
of drug-class combinations are feasible. We utilize electroencephalogram data 
collected from human subjects who received general anesthesia with sevoflurane 
and general anesthesia with the drug-class combination of 
sevoflurane-plus-ketamine. We demonstrate improved performance predicting 
anesthesia-induced brain-states using drug-specific models.

Automatic Detection of General Anesthetic-States using ECG-Derived Autonomic 
Nervous System Features.

Polk SL, Kashkooli K, Nagaraj SB, Chamadia S, Murphy JM, Sun H, Westover MB, 
Barbieri R, Akeju O.

Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based prediction systems are used to target 
anesthetic-states in patients undergoing procedures with general anesthesia 
(GA). These systems are not widely employed in resource-limited settings because 
they are cost-prohibitive. Although anesthetic-drugs induce highly-structured, 
oscillatory neural dynamics that make EEG-based systems a principled approach 
for anesthetic-state monitoring, anesthetic-drugs also significantly modulate 
the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Because ANS dynamics can be inferred from 
electrocardiogram (ECG) features such as heart rate variability, it may be 
possible to develop an ECG-based system to infer anesthetic-states as a low-cost 
and practical alternative to EEG-based anesthetic-state prediction systems. In 
this work, we demonstrate that an ECG-based system using ANS features can be 
used to discriminate between non-GA and GA states in sevoflurane, with a GA F1 
score of 0.834, [95% CI, 0.776, 0.892], and in sevoflurane-plus-ketamine, with a 
GA F1 score of 0.880 [0.815, 0.954]. With further refinement, ECG-based 
anesthetic-state systems could be developed as a fully automated system for 
anesthetic-state monitoring in resource-limited settings.

A New Neural Mass Model Driven Method and Its Application in Early Epileptic 
Seizure Detection.

Song JL, Li Q, Zhang B, Westover MB, Zhang R.

OBJECTIVE: Despite numerous neural computational models proposed to explain 
physiological and pathological mechanisms of brain activity, a large gap remains 
between theory and application of the models. Building on the successful 
application of data-driven  in epileptic seizure detection, we aim to 
build a bridge between data and models in this paper.
: We first propose a novel model-driven seizure detection method based on 
dynamic features in epileptic EEGs, where the rationale for dynamic features in 
epileptic EEGs can be clarified in theory by characterizing the variation of 
parameters of the model. Then we apply the proposed D&F-model-driven method to 
the problem of early epileptic seizure detection, where the evolution of model 
parameters selected and optimized by the proposed method is measured and used to 
detect the starting point of the seizure.
RESULTS: Numerical results on two open EEG databases demonstrate that our 
proposed method does a good job of early epileptic seizure detection. The 
average detection sensitivity, false positive rate and early detection period 
attain 100%, 0.1/h, and 7.1 s respectively.
CONCLUSION: This paper provides a strategy to characterize EEG signals using a 
NMM-related method and the model parameters optimized by real EEG may then serve 
as features in their own right for early seizure detection.
SIGNIFICANCE: An useful attempt to early detect epileptic seizures by combining 
the neural mass model with data analysis.

Adaptive Sedation Monitoring From EEG in ICU Patients With Online Learning.

Zheng WL, Sun H, Akeju O, Westover MB.

Sedative medications are routinely administered to provide comfort and 
facilitate clinical care in critically ill ICU patients. Prior work shows that 
brain monitoring using electroencephalography (EEG) to track sedation levels may 
help medical personnel to optimize drug dosing and avoid the adverse effects of 
oversedation and undersedation. However, the performance of sedation monitoring 
 proposed to date deal poorly with individual variability across 
patients, leading to inconsistent performance. To address this challenge we 
develop an online learning approach based on Adaptive Regularization of Weight 
Vectors (AROW). Our approach adaptively updates a sedation level prediction 
algorithm under a continuously evolving data distribution. The prediction model 
is gradually calibrated for individual patients in response to EEG observations 
and routine clinical assessments over time. The evaluations are performed on a 
population of 172 sedated ICU patients whose sedation levels were assessed using 
the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (scores between -5 = comatose and 0 = 
awake). The proposed adaptive model achieves better performance than the same 
model without adaptation (average accuracies with tolerance of one level 
difference: 68.76% vs. 61.10%). Moreover, our approach is shown to be robust to 
sudden changes caused by label noise. Medication administrations have different 
effects on model performance. We find that the model performs best in patients 
receiving only propofol, compared to patients receiving no sedation or multiple 
simultaneous sedative medications.

Rapid Annotation of Seizures and Interictal-ictal Continuum EEG Patterns.

Jing J, d’Angremont E, Zafar S, Rosenthal ES, Tabaeizadeh M, Ebrahim S, Dauwels 
J, Westover MB.

Seizures, status epilepticus, and seizure-like rhythmic or periodic activities 
are common, pathological, harmful states of brain electrical activity seen in 
the electroencephalogram (EEG) of patients during critical medical illnesses or 
acute brain injury. Accumulating evidence shows that these states, when 
prolonged, cause neurological injury. In this study we developed a valid method 
to automatically discover a small number of homogeneous pattern clusters, to 
facilitate efficient interactive labelling by EEG experts. 592 time domain and 
spectral features were extracted from continuous EEG (cEEG) data of 369 ICU 
(intensive care unit) patients. For each patient, feature dimensionality was 
reduced using principal component analysis (PCA), retaining 95% of the variance. 
K-medoids clustering was applied to learn a local dictionary from each patient, 
consisting of k=100 exemplars/words. Changepoint detection (CPD) was utilized to 
break each EEG into segments. A bag-of-words (BoW) representation was computed 
for each segment, specifically, a normalized histogram of the words found within 
each segment. Segments were further clustered using the BoW histograms by 
Affinity Propagation (AP) using a χ2 distance to measure similarities between 
histograms. The resulting 30 50 clusters for each patient were scored by EEG 
experts through labeling only the cluster medoids. Embedding  t-SNE 
(t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) and PCA were used to provide a 2D 
representation for visualization and exploration of the data. Our results 
illustrate that it takes approximately 3 minutes to annotate 24 hours of cEEG by 
experts, which is at least 60 times faster than unaided manual review.

EEG CLassification Via Convolutional Neural Network-Based Interictal 
Epileptiform Event Detection.

Thomas J, Comoretto L, Jin J, Dauwels J, Cash SS, Westover MB.

Diagnosis of epilepsy based on visual inspection of electroencephalogram (EEG) 
abnormalities is an inefficient, time-consuming, and expert-centered process. 
Moreover, the diagnosis based on ictal epileptiform events is challenging as the 
ictal patterns are infrequent. Consequently, the development of an automated, 
fast, and reliable epileptic EEG diagnostic system is essential. The interictal 
epileptiform discharges (IEDs) are recurring patterns that are highly suggestive 
of epilepsy. In this paper, we propose an epileptic EEG classification system 
based on IED detection. The proposed system comprises of three modules: 
pre-processing, waveform-level classification, and EEG-level classification. We 
employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for waveform-level classification 
and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for EEG-level classification. We evaluated 
the proposed system on a dataset of 156 EEGs recorded at Massachusetts General 
Hospital (MGH), Boston. The system achieved a mean 4-fold classification 
accuracy of 83.86% for classifying EEGs with and without IEDs.

A Mean Field Model of Acute Hepatic Encephalopathy.

Song J, Sun H, Jing J, Carlos L, Chao L, Cash SS, Zhang R, Westover MB.

Acute hepatic encephalopathy (AHE) is a common form of delirium, a state of 
confusion, impaired attention, and decreased arousal due to acute liver failure. 
However, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying AHE are poorly understood. 
In order to develop hypotheses for mechanisms of AHE, our work builds on an 
existing neural mean field model for similar EEG patterns in cerebral anoxia, 
the bursting Liley model. The model proposes that generalized periodic 
discharges, similar to the triphasic waves (TPWs) seen in severe AHE, arise 
through three types of processes a) increased neuronal excitability; b) 
defective brain energy metabolism leading to impaired synaptic transmission; c) 
and enhanced postsynaptic inhibition mediated by increased GABA-ergic and 
glycinergic transmission. We relate the model parameters to human EEG data using 
a particle-filter based optimization method that matches the TPW 
inter-event-interval distribution of the model with that observed in patients 
EEGs. In this way our model relates microscopic mechanisms to EEG patterns. Our 
model represents a starting point for exploring the underlying mechanisms of 
brain dynamics in delirium.

Electroencephalogram Based Detection of Deep Sedation in ICU Patients Using 
Atomic Decomposition.

Nagaraj SB, McClain LM, Boyle EJ, Zhou DW, Ramaswamy SM, Biswal S, Akeju O, 
Purdon PL, Westover MB.

OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to evaluate how well states of deep sedation 
in ICU patients can be detected from the frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) 
using features based on the method of atomic decomposition (AD).
: We analyzed a clinical dataset of 20 min of EEG recordings per patient 
from 44 mechanically ventilated adult patients receiving sedatives in an 
intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Several features derived from AD of the EEG 
signal were used to discriminate between awake and sedated states. We trained 
support vector machine (SVM) classifiers using AD features and compared the 
classification performance with SVM classifiers trained using standard spectral 
and entropy features using leave-one-subject-out validation. The potential of 
each feature to discriminate between awake and sedated states was quantified 
using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
RESULTS: The sedation level classification system using AD was able to reliably 
discriminate between sedated and awake states achieving an average AUC of 0.90, 
which was significantly better () than performance achieved using spectral (AUC 
= 0.86) and entropy (AUC = 0.81) domain features. A combined feature set 
consisting of AD, entropy, and spectral features provided better discrimination 
(AUC = 0.91, ) than any individual feature set.
CONCLUSIONS: Features derived from the atomic decomposition of EEG signals 
provide useful discriminative information about the depth of sedation in ICU 
patients.
SIGNIFICANCE: With further refinement and external validation, the proposed 
system may be able to assist clinical staff with continuous surveillance of 
sedation levels in mechanically ventilated critically ill ICU patients.

Concerns regarding reliability and safety, as well as uncertainties about what 
constitutes adequate performance evaluation, have impeded the clinical 
translation of PCLC devices. We describe an attempt to address these challenges 
through design, implementation, and evaluation of a PCLC device for delivering 
medically-induced coma, with the intention to eventually conduct a clinical 
trial. This device works by automatically adjusting the infusion rate of 
propofol - a general anesthetic - in response to an electroencephalogram (EEG) 
pattern called burst suppression. We also designed and implemented a 
computational patient model which interfaces with hardware and produces 
realistic EEG signals in response to propofol infusion. The computational 
patient model is used in hardware-in-the-loop studies to evaluate the behavior 
of our PCLC device under realistic perturbations. Finally, we have tested the 
performance of our PCLC device in rodents. Results from these studies suggest 
that closed-loop control of medically-induced coma in humans is feasible and 
robust. Consequently, our work produced a PCLC device and relevant pre-clinical 
evidence in support of a pilot clinical trial.

Automated epileptiform spike detection via affinity propagation-based template 
matching.

Thomas J, Jing Jin, Dauwels J, Cash SS, Westover MB.

Interictal epileptiform spikes are the key diagnostic biomarkers for epilepsy. 
The clinical gold standard of spike detection is visual inspection performed by 
neurologists. This is a tedious, time-consuming, and expert-centered process. 
The development of automated spike detection systems is necessary in order to 
provide a faster and more reliable diagnosis of epilepsy. In this paper, we 
propose an efficient template matching spike detector based on a combination of 
spike and background waveform templates. We generate a template library by 
clustering a collection of spikes and background waveforms extracted from a 
database of 50 patients with epilepsy. We benchmark the performance of five 
clustering techniques based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curves. In addition, background templates are integrated with existing spike 
templates to improve the overall performance. The affinity propagation-based 
template matching system with a combination of spike and background templates is 
shown to outperform the other four conventional  with the highest 
area-under-curve (AUC) of 0.953.

Heart rate variability as a biomarker for sedation depth estimation in ICU 
patients.

Nagaraj SB, Ramaswamy SM, Biswal S, Boyle EJ, Zhou DW, Mcclain LM, Rosenthal ES, 
Purdon PL, Westover MB.

An automated patient-specific system to classify the level of sedation in ICU 
patients using heart rate variability signal is presented in this paper. ECG 
from 70 mechanically ventilated adult patients with administered sedatives in an 
ICU setting were used to develop a support vector machine based system for 
sedation depth monitoring using several heart rate variability measures. A 
leave-one-subject-out cross validation was used for classifier training and 
performance evaluations. The proposed patient-specific system provided a 
sensitivity, specificity and an AUC of 64%, 84.8% and 0.72, respectively. It is 
hoped that with the help of additional physiological signals the proposed 
patient-specific sedation level prediction system could lead to a fully 
automated multimodal system to assist clinical staff in ICUs to interpret the 
sedation level of the patient.

Labouré College (CSB), Milton, MA.

BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers resulting from continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring in 
hospitalized patients have gained attention as a preventable medical 
complication. We measured their incidence and risk factors.
: We performed an observational investigation of cEEG-electrode-related 
pressure ulcers (EERPU) among acutely ill patients over a 22-month period. 
Variables analyzed included age, sex, monitoring duration, hospital location, 
application , vasopressor usage, nutritional status, skin allergies, 
fever, and presence/severity of EERPU. We examined risk for pressure ulcers vs 
monitoring duration using Kaplan-Meyer survival analysis, and performed 
multivariate risk assessment using Cox proportional hazard model.
RESULTS: Among 1,519 patients, EERPU occurred in 118 (7.8%). Most (n = 109, 
92.3%) consisted of hyperemia only without skin breakdown. A major predictor was 
monitoring duration, with 3-, 5-, and 10-day risks of 16%, 32%, and 60%, 
respectively. Risk factors included older age (mean age 60.65 vs 50.3, p < 
0.01), care in an intensive care unit (9.37% vs 5.32%, p < 0.01), lack of a head 
wrap (8.31% vs 27.3%, p = 0.02), use of vasopressors (16.7% vs 9.64%, p < 0.01), 
enteral feeding (11.7% vs 5.45%, p = 0.04), and fever (18.4% vs 9.3%, p < 0.01). 
Elderly patients (71-80 years) were at higher risk (hazard ratio 6.84 [1.95-24], 
p < 0.01), even after accounting for monitoring time and other pertinent 
variables in multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: EERPU are uncommon and generally mild. Elderly patients and those 
with more severe illness have higher risk of developing EERPU, and the risk 
increases as a function of monitoring duration.

Spatial variation in automated burst suppression detection in pharmacologically 
induced coma.

An J, Jonnalagadda D, Moura V, Purdon PL, Brown EN, Westover MB.

Burst suppression is actively studied as a control signal to guide anesthetic 
dosing in patients undergoing medically induced coma. The ability to 
automatically identify periods of EEG suppression and compactly summarize the 
depth of coma using the burst suppression probability (BSP) is crucial to 
effective and safe monitoring and control of medical coma. Current literature 
however does not explicitly account for the potential variation in burst 
suppression parameters across different scalp locations. In this study we 
analyzed standard 19-channel EEG recordings from 8 patients with refractory 
status epilepticus who underwent pharmacologically induced burst suppression as 
medical treatment for refractory seizures. We found that although burst 
suppression is generally considered a global phenomenon, BSP obtained using a 
previously validated algorithm varies systematically across different channels. 
A global representation of information from individual channels is proposed that 
takes into account the burst suppression characteristics recorded at multiple 
electrodes. BSP computed from this representative burst suppression pattern may 
be more resilient to noise and a better representation of the brain state of 
patients. Multichannel data integration may enhance the reliability of estimates 
of the depth of medical coma.

Clustering analysis to identify distinct spectral components of encephalogram 
burst suppression in critically ill patients.

Zhou DW, Westover MB, McClain LM, Nagaraj SB, Bajwa EK, Quraishi SA, Akeju O, 
Cobb JP, Purdon PL.

Millions of patients are admitted each year to intensive care units (ICUs) in 
the United States. A significant fraction of ICU survivors develop life-long 
cognitive impairment, incurring tremendous financial and societal costs. 
Delirium, a state of impaired awareness, attention and cognition that frequently 
develops during ICU care, is a major risk factor for post-ICU cognitive 
impairment. Recent studies suggest that patients experiencing 
electroencephalogram (EEG) burst suppression have higher rates of mortality and 
are more likely to develop delirium than patients who do not experience burst 
suppression. Burst suppression is typically associated with coma and deep levels 
of anesthesia or hypothermia, and is defined clinically as an alternating 
pattern of high-amplitude "burst" periods interrupted by sustained low-amplitude 
"suppression" periods. Here we describe a clustering method to analyze EEG 
spectra during burst and suppression periods. We used this method to identify a 
set of distinct spectral patterns in the EEG during burst and suppression 
periods in critically ill patients. These patterns correlate with level of 
patient sedation, quantified in terms of sedative infusion rates and clinical 
sedation scores. This analysis suggests that EEG burst suppression in critically 
ill patients may not be a single state, but instead may reflect a plurality of 
states whose specific dynamics relate to a patient's underlying brain function.

Automated information extraction from free-text EEG reports.

Biswal S, Nip Z, Moura Junior V, Bianchi MT, Rosenthal ES, Westover MB.

In this study we have developed a supervised learning to automatically detect 
with high accuracy EEG reports that describe seizures and epileptiform 
discharges. We manually labeled 3,277 documents as describing one or more 
seizures vs no seizures, and as describing epileptiform discharges vs no 
epileptiform discharges. We then used Naïve Bayes to develop a system able to 
automatically classify EEG reports into these categories. Our system consisted 
of normalization techniques, extraction of key sentences, and automated feature 
selection using cross validation. As candidate features we used key words and 
special word patterns called elastic word sequences (EWS). Final feature 
selection was accomplished via sequential backward selection. We used cross 
validation to predict out of sample performance. Our automated feature selection 
procedure resulted in a classifier with 38 features for seizure detection, and 
23 features for epileptiform discharge detection. The average [95% CI] area 
under the receiver operating curve was 99.05 [98.79, 99.32]% for detecting 
reports with seizures, and 96.15 [92.31, 100.00]% for detecting reports with 
epileptiform discharges. The methodology described herein greatly reduces the 
manual labor involved in identifying large cohorts of patients for retrospective 
neurophysiological studies of patients with epilepsy.

An enhanced cerebral recovery index for coma prognostication following cardiac 
arrest.

Ghassemi MM, Amorim E, Pati SB, Mark RG, Brown EN, Purdon PL, Westover MB.

Prognostication of coma outcomes following cardiac arrest is both qualitative 
and poorly understood in current practice. Existing quantitative metrics are 
powerful, but lack rigorous approaches to classification. This is due, in part, 
to a lack of available data on the population of . In this paper we 
describe a novel retrospective data set of 167 cardiac arrest patients (spanning 
three institutions) who received electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring. We 
utilized a subset of the collected data to generate features that measured the 
connectivity, complexity and category of EEG activity. A subset of these 
features was included in a logistic regression model to estimate a dichotomized 
cerebral performance category score at discharge. We compared the predictive 
performance of our method against an established EEG-based alternative, the 
Cerebral Recovery Index (CRI) and show that our approach more reliably 
classifies patient outcomes, with an average increase in AUC of 0.27.

SpikeGUI: software for rapid interictal discharge annotation via template 
matching and online machine learning.

Jing Jin, Dauwels J, Cash S, Westover MB.

Detection of interictal discharges is a key element of interpreting EEGs during 
the diagnosis and management of epilepsy. Because interpretation of clinical EEG 
data is time-intensive and reliant on experts who are in short supply, there is 
a great need for automated spike detectors. However, attempts to develop 
general-purpose spike detectors have so far been severely limited by a lack of 
expert-annotated data. Huge databases of interictal discharges are therefore in 
great demand for the development of general-purpose detectors. Detailed manual 
annotation of interictal discharges is time consuming, which severely limits the 
willingness of experts to participate. To address such problems, a graphical 
user interface "SpikeGUI" was developed in our work for the purposes of EEG 
viewing and rapid interictal discharge annotation. "SpikeGUI" substantially 
speeds up the task of annotating interictal discharges using a custom-built 
algorithm based on a combination of template matching and online machine 
learning techniques. While the algorithm is currently tailored to annotation of 
interictal epileptiform discharges, it can easily be generalized to other 
waveforms and signal types.

Sparse extreme learning machine for classification.

Bai Z, Huang GB, Wang D, Wang H, Westover MB.

Extreme learning machine (ELM) was initially proposed for single-hidden-layer 
feedforward neural networks (SLFNs). In the hidden layer (feature mapping), 
nodes are randomly generated independently of training data. Furthermore, a 
unified ELM was proposed, providing a single framework to simplify and unify 
different learning , such as SLFNs, least square support vector machines, 
proximal support vector machines, and so on. However, the solution of unified 
ELM is dense, and thus, usually plenty of storage space and testing time are 
required for large-scale applications. In this paper, a sparse ELM is proposed 
as an alternative solution for classification, reducing storage space and 
testing time. In addition, unified ELM obtains the solution by matrix inversion, 
whose computational complexity is between quadratic and cubic with respect to 
the training size. It still requires plenty of training time for large-scale 
problems, even though it is much faster than many other traditional . In 
this paper, an efficient training algorithm is specifically developed for sparse 
ELM. The quadratic programming problem involved in sparse ELM is divided into a 
series of smallest possible sub-problems, each of which are solved analytically. 
Compared with SVM, sparse ELM obtains better generalization performance with 
much faster training speed. Compared with unified ELM, sparse ELM achieves 
similar generalization performance for binary classification applications, and 
when dealing with large-scale binary classification problems, sparse ELM 
realizes even faster training speed than unified ELM.

Respiratory motion may significantly affect the outcome in a number of medical 
imaging techniques and some radiation therapy applications. 4-dimensional 
computed tomography (4DCT) and respiratory gating technology, which account for 
the dynamics of respiration, are expensive and often unavailable in smaller 
radiation treatment centers. Here we evaluate the ability of an inexpensive, 
technology comprised of two capacitors placed next to the skin to provide 
real-time respiratory phase information. Three subjects were simultaneously 
monitored by the new capacitor-based device (CBD) and a commercially available 
Real time Position Management (RPM) system by Varian. All respiratory phases 
detected by the RPM system were also detected by the CBD. Automatically detected 
peaks were not significantly different in timing when comparing RPM and 
CBD-derived respiratory amplitudes. The anatomic locations of the CBD were 
varied to evaluate the change in signal quality across the abdomen and thorax. 
CBD signals were reliable on the abdomen and lower thorax but degraded when 
recorded from the upper thorax. We also used computed tomography (CT) to assess 
the imaging characteristics of CBD and found that there were minimal artifacts. 
We therefore conclude that CBD respiratory amplitude measurements may be useful 
for tracking respiratory movements as part of a number of advanced radiation 
therapy technologies including 4DCT image resorting, adaptive radiation therapy 
and gated radiation therapy.

We provide a method for estimating brain metabolic state based on a 
reduced-order model of EEG burst suppression. The model, derived from previously 
suggested biophysical mechanisms of burst suppression, describes important 
electrophysiological features and provides a direct link to cerebral metabolic 
rate. We design and fit the estimation method from EEG recordings of burst 
suppression from a neurological intensive care unit and test it on real and

Sensitivity of compressed spectral arrays for detecting seizures in acutely ill 
adults.

Williamson CA, Wahlster S, Shafi MM, Westover MB.

 information:
Department of Neurosurgery, University of Michigan Hospital, Ann Arbor, MI, 
USA, craigaw@med.umich.edu.

BACKGROUND: Continuous EEG recordings (cEEGs) are increasingly used in 
evaluation of acutely ill adults. Pre-screening using compressed data formats, 
such as compressed spectral array (CSA), may accelerate EEG review. We tested 
whether screening with CSA can enable detection of seizures and other relevant 
patterns.
: Two individuals reviewed the CSA displays of 113 cEEGs. While blinded 
to the raw EEG data, they marked each visually homogeneous CSA segment. An 
independent experienced electroencephalographer reviewed the raw EEG within 60 s 
on either side of each mark and recorded any seizures (and isolated epileptiform 
discharges, periodic epileptiform discharges (PEDs), rhythmic delta activity 
(RDA), and focal or generalized slowing). Seizures were considered to have been 
detected if the CSA mark was within 60 s of the seizure. The 
electroencephalographer then determined the total number of seizures (and other 
critical findings) for each record by exhaustive, page-by-page review of the 
entire raw EEG.
RESULTS: Within each of the 39 cEEG recordings containing seizures, one CSA 
reviewer identified at least one seizure, while the second CSA reviewer 
identified 38/39 patients with seizures. The overall detection rate was 89.0 % 
of 1,190 total seizures. When present, an average of 87.9 % of seizures were 
detected per individual patient. Detection rates for other critical findings 
were as follows: epileptiform discharges, 94.0 %; PEDs, 100 %; RDA, 97.9 %; 
focal slowing, 100 %; and generalized slowing, 100 %.
CONCLUSIONS: CSA-guided review can support sensitive screening of critical 
pathological information in cEEG recordings. However, some patients with 
seizures may not be identified.

Power law versus exponential state transition dynamics: application to 
sleep-wake architecture.

Chu-Shore J, Westover MB, Bianchi MT.

 information:
Institute for Quantitative Social Science, Harvard University, Cambridge, 
Massachusetts, United States of America.

BACKGROUND: Despite the common experience that interrupted sleep has a negative 
impact on waking function, the features of human sleep-wake architecture that 
best distinguish sleep continuity versus fragmentation remain elusive. In this 
regard, there is growing  in characterizing sleep architecture using 
models of the temporal dynamics of sleep-wake stage transitions. In humans and 
other mammals, the state transitions defining sleep and wake bout durations have 
been described with exponential and power law models, respectively. However, 
sleep-wake stage distributions are often complex, and distinguishing between 
exponential and power law processes is not always straightforward. Although 
mono-exponential distributions are distinct from power law distributions, 
multi-exponential distributions may in fact resemble power laws by appearing 
linear on a log-log plot.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To characterize the parameters that may allow 
these distributions to mimic one another, we systematically fitted 
multi-exponential-generated distributions with a power law model, and power 
law-generated distributions with multi-exponential models. We used the 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov method to investigate goodness of fit for the "incorrect" 
model over a range of parameters. The "zone of mimicry" of parameters that 
increased the risk of mistakenly accepting power law fitting resembled empiric 
time constants obtained in human sleep and wake bout distributions.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Recognizing this uncertainty in model distinction 
impacts interpretation of transition dynamics (self-organizing versus 
probabilistic), and the generation of predictive models for clinical 
classification of normal and pathological sleep architecture.

OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate computer algorithms with high negative 
predictive values that augment traditional surveillance for central 
line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
SETTING: Barnes-Jewish Hospital, a 1,250-bed tertiary care academic hospital in 
Saint Louis, Missouri.
: We evaluated all adult patients in intensive care units who had blood 
samples collected during the period from July 1, 2005, to June 30, 2006, that 
were positive for a recognized pathogen on culture. Each isolate recovered from 
culture was evaluated using the definitions for nosocomial CLABSI provided by 
the National Healthcare Safety Network of the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention. Using manual surveillance by infection prevention specialists as the 
gold standard, we assessed the ability of various combinations of dichotomous 
rules to determine whether an isolate was associated with a CLABSI. Sensitivity, 
specificity, and predictive values were calculated.
RESULTS: Infection prevention specialists identified 67 cases of CLABSI 
associated with 771 isolates recovered from blood samples. The algorithms 
excluded approximately 40%-62% of the isolates from consideration as possible 
causes of CLABSI. The simplest algorithm, with 2 dichotomous rules (ie, the 
collection of blood samples more than 48 hours after admission and the presence 
of a central venous catheter within 48 hours before collection of blood 
samples), had the highest negative predictive value (99.4%) and the lowest 
specificity (44.2%) for CLABSI. Augmentation of this algorithm with rules for 
common skin contaminants confirmed by another positive blood culture result 
yielded in a negative predictive value of 99.2% and a specificity of 68.0%.
CONCLUSIONS: An automated approach to surveillance for CLABSI that is 
characterized by a high negative predictive value can accurately identify and 
exclude positive culture results not representing CLABSI from further manual 
surveillance.

Layer 4C in monkey V1 may linearize the output of the LGN.

Westover MB, Anderson CH.

Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, School of Medicine, Washington 
University, 4496 Maryland Avenue 1-8, St Louis, MO 63110, USA.

In primates, most LGN fibers terminate in cortical layer 4C, an anatomically 
prominent structure of unexplained function. We hypothesize that the enormous 
number of cells in layer 4C of monkey primate visual cortex functions as a 
neural network "hidden layer" that inverts distortions introduced by 
transmitting visual signals through the LGN. This hypothesis helps explain how 
simple cells respond (quasi-) linearly to visual inputs in spite of 
nonlinearities present in LGN responses. Linearization averts prematurely 
discarding visual information, in keeping with the role of primary visual cortex 
as the source of raw visual information to the rest of the brain.

The neural multiple access channel.

Fischer BJ, Westover MB.

 information:
Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, USA.

In many neural systems, independently encoded information must at some point be 
transmitted over the spike train of one neuron. We introduce a method for 
quantitatively studying the effects of the signal encoding and transmission 
processes on the rates of transmission of multiple sources of information over 
one spike train, using the multiple access channel model from network 
information theory. To illustrate this method we study the effects of a small 
set of synaptic input patterns and input signal power spectra on the information 
capacity region of a simple three-neuron system.

The otolith organs in the vestibular system are excellent detectors of linear 
accelerations. However, any measurement of linear acceleration is ambiguous 
between a tilt in a gravitational field and an inertial acceleration. Angelaki 
et al. have put forward a general hypothesis about how inertial accelerations 
can be computed based on vestibular signals (J. Neurosci. 19 (1999) 316). We 
have constructed a realistic, detailed model of the relevant systems to test 
this hypothesis. The model produces useful predictions about what kinds of 
neurons should be found in the vestibular nucleus if such a computation is 
actually performed in the vestibular system. The model is constructed using 
general principles of neurobiological simulation (J. Neurophys. 84 (2000) 2113).

The population vector is a linear decoder for an ensemble of neurons, whose 
response properties are nonlinear functions of the input vector. However, 
previous analyses of this decoder seem to have missed the observation that the 
population vector can also be used to estimate functions of the input vector. We 
explore the use of singular value decomposition to delineate the set of 
functions which are linearly decodable from a given population of noisy neurons.
